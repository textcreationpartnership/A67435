            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Fear the heat of our laſt Encounter may have done me ſome prejudice in your good opinion, and would juſtifie to you, if I can, both my zeal and my friendſhip. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me therefore with a more ſettled calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give you the Reaſons which ſway'd with me then, but which the promptneſs of my nature poſſibly might ſo diſguiſe, that they might not then appear reaſon to you. As this is my only, ſo I hope 'twill be my full juſtification; for though we ow much to friendſhip, we ow more to Truth, and that Friend who bars the uſe of reaſon in his Friend, does, in my judgment, ill deſerve that Name. Notwithſtanding let me add what I think you are already ſufficiently perſwaded of, that I am far from the blind zeal of thoſe who think Popery an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo ſcandalous and contagious, that it deſtroyes all correſpondence with thoſe who own it. I have met with ſeveral, beſides your ſelf, of your judgment in Religion, accompliſht men, and ſo qualified, that I cannot but wiſh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that all ſuch men were Proteſtants, or all Proteſtants ſuch men. I think ſo well of ſome parts of your Religion, that there are who think the worſe of me. I read your books alwayes without hatred, and ſometimes with pity at the unequal combat betwixt the Knight and the Giant, though I make no doubt you are even with us in this particular, and are all Knights in your own Countreys When I hear Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cry out Papiſts, and Popery, I have ſometimes the blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ask what they mean; for having heard them apply'd both to Prelatics and Fanatics, they muſt needs be words of a ſtrangely large ſize, and magical comprehenſion, if they can fit parties ſo different, and what know I but they may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:3"/> be ſo explain'd, that you may own them no more than other folks? In fine, I look upon my reaſon as one of the greateſt gifts I have receiv'd from God, and am perſwaded 'tis a duty I ow him to uſe it as well as I can. Wherefore I as little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the paſſionate zeal of our ſide, as I underſtand the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime perfection of blind obedience on yours; but where I ſee you have reaſon, I am content to allow you have ſo. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, Friend, I muſt continue conſtant to what I maintain'd at our laſt meeting. I love my King and my Countrey as I ought, and can neither believe that can be a true Religion which teaches doctrines inconſiſtent with Government, nor believe otherwiſe but that yours does teach ſuch doctrines. And though I know their peſtilent influence does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes work, for you have in the late times of tryal appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your ſelves honeſt men, yet I cannot think that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſafe in which they are either tolerated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd at. Of this I will make your ſelf Judge, and in this Paper produce my evidence, which ſhall be the very words of the moſt famous Authors amongſt you, who if they be ſufficient for number, and conſiderable for learning, and plain in expreſſion, and own'd for yours, I ſee not what more can be expected from me, nor what at all can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by you or any elſe.</p>
                     <p>To begin then, there are I muſt confeſs ſome modeſt men amongſt you,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pon. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> who ſpeak ſparingly of the Pope, and affirm <hi>Princes are not the Popes Vicars.</hi> Theſe exempt from his Soveraignty the greateſt part of the World, for they make <hi>Infidel Princes true and ſupreme Princes of their own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> and ſay, <hi>the Pope is not Lord of thoſe poſſeſſions which Infidels hold.</hi> Nay they go ſo far as to dare ſay, He is not, <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE DIVINO, Lord</hi> ſo much as <hi>of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Id. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> And that all his power to depoſe Princes, and diſpoſe of their Kingdoms is only <hi>indirectly,</hi> and <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> which alas! is a matter of nothing, and he muſt needs be a very ſcrupulous man who boggles at it. For this opinion are cited beſides two Cardinals, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Cajetan,</hi> abundance of other famous men with hard names, <hi>Henricus</hi> and <hi>Joannes Driedo, Turrecremata, Pighius, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:3"/> Petrus de Palude, Franc. Victoria, Dominicus Soto, Sanderus, Aſpileveta, Covarruvias,</hi> and ſo many others, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirms it is <hi>communis ſententia Catholicorum The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologorum,</hi> though in that particular, as you will preſently ſee, he was a little out. But theſe, as many and as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they are, are but dow-bak't men, and ſcent ſtrongly of wicked carnal policy, and hereſie too, as an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fairly inſinuates by the title of his Book,<note place="margin">Alex.

                        <hi>adverſus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios Politicos, &amp; noſtri temporis Haereticos,</hi> deſign principally againſt this opinion. And ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſcap't fairly; for <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> if the information I had from a very good hand deceive me not, had a great mind to have burnt his book: Though he ſcap'd more narrowly at <hi>Paris</hi> for giving too much to the Pope, than at <hi>Rome</hi> for giving too little. His fellow <hi>Suarez</hi> had his book burnt there by the common Hangman, and he was found guilty of the ſame fault: but he was a Cardinal, for which reſpect I ſuppoſe they dealt more mercifully, and only condemn'd and forbid him. But this by the by. Your hearty men, whom the bugbears of carnal policy cannot fright from the defence of truth, tell us another ſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſay plainly what we muſt truſt too. <hi>

                        <hi>there be one ſupreme Monarch in the Church in all things, the unity of the Church cannot be preſerved: for ſeeing the Church by divine inſtitution doth conſiſt of a Kingdom and a Prieſthood, if it were otherwiſe, there ſhould be in the ſame abſolutely one Monarch of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and another of the Prieſthood: That if for avoiding diſſentions about ſacred cauſes, one ſupreme Head is appointed; why not in the ſame manner of the Kingdom, that there ſhould be one and the ſame Head both of the Kingdom and Prieſthood, leſt in like ſort there ſhould happen diſſention betwixt them? that therefore it is the rather to be held that</hi> Peter <hi>doth ſupply Chriſts place, not only in the Prieſthood, but in the Kingdom, that he might be a King, and likewiſe a Prieſt according to the order of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>who was both a King and Prieſt.</hi> The famous Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> ſayes the ſame:<note place="margin">Baron.

                        <hi>That</hi> David <hi>did foretell that the Prieſthood of Chriſt ſhould be according to the order of</hi> Melchiſedech: <hi>That when Chriſt being a King
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:4"/> and a Prieſt received all judgment of the Father, that is, most full, judicial power; He joyning the ſame with his Prieſthood did inſtitute in the Church a regal Prieſthood, tranſlating</hi> in ſuos (I conceive he means St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors) <hi>all the power he had of his Father.</hi> This new coronation of King <hi>Peter</hi> ſo long after his death, and the myſtery of King and Prieſt meeting in <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> never dreamt of, though he treat the ſubject particularly, and ſomething to better purpoſe, and the admirable expedient to avoid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions by taking away Regal power are pleaſant matters, and deſerve to be reflected on, but that I have ſo much of this divertive ſtuff to produce that I cannot ſtay every where. <hi>Thomas Bozius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Tho. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But to our purpoſe. The method of diſcourſe requires now that I ſhould apply theſe ſayings to the matter in hand, but the application is ſo eaſie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that to ſpend time in it muſt needs be equally tedious and needleſs. For pray tell me, can any Commonwealth be ſafe, or ſubſiſt at all, if Princes have no dominion but what they receive from the Pope? If they hold their Empires and Kingdoms of him? if they may abſolve their ſubjects from allegeance, and transfer their rights from one line to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If they be his Miniſters, his Vaſſals, his Subjects? If their power be miniſterial and ſubſervient to the Papal, to be exerciſ'd at his beck, and be at his command both corrigible and revocable? If any thing be plain in the world, this is, that either Princes muſt be taken out of the world, or theſe Maxims. For without more ado he that makes a Prince be a Subject, makes him no Prince, ſpeaking as I do of abſolute Princes. Wherefore leaving theſe things, and their application to your conſideration, I turn my ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on what I concieve you may reply.</p>
                     <p>Two things there are which I have heard alledged in your behalf with ſome appearance, but not much ſubſtance. Firſt, that notwithſtanding all this, Catholic Princes do live ſafely, and govern quietly, and therefore to conclude theſe doctrines are inconſiſtent with government, is to conclude that cannot be done, which we plainly ſee is done. Next, that while men are men there will be <hi>quot capita tot ſententiae;</hi> that nature is not furniſht with means to confine the fancies of private men to the limits of ſtrict reaſon; that theſe are problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Queſtions which particular men diſpute into probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but for which the Church is not reſponſible, having never either defined, or otherwiſe ingaged her authority for them. To the firſt I reply that a certain King took poyſon ſo long that it became food to him, and yet I think poyſon for all that a very dangerous thing, and very inconſiſtent with health. The Princes you mention have Antidotes undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with which I am not acquainted; but let the Antidote
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:8"/> be never ſo good, poyſon will be poyſon ſtill. And truly I think Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> did honeſtly, when finding ſome paſſages in the book which <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. writ againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> of which by the King's command he had the peruſal, and in which he thought the Pope was complemented a little too far, he repreſented to the King that one day poſſibly they might fall out, as afterwards they did, and that then He might wiſh ſome things unſaid. While thoſe Princes and the Pope continue friends, they need not much apprehend, and poſſibly are not much accquainted with what paſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Scholars, for they are ſure enough that, for his own ſake, He will not uſe his power againſt thoſe who maintain his intereſt. It may be too with Princes as with other men, who to compaſs ſome end upon which they are paſſionately ſet at preſent, value not a miſchief, much more conſiderable than the loſs of their preſent pretences, which is farther of. If the Pope can aſſiſt either French or Spaniard, the Divines of that King whoſe part he takes may ſay any thing freely; and Staſemen who have little eſteem of Shoolmen, will think the Pope ſufficiently over-reacht, when for a few pleaſing words they have got peradventure a Town or Province. So that your Princes ſeem to be alwayes playing with the Pope at <hi>Vy Politics;</hi> in which game they think their ſteel to his quils ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage enough; though I ſhould think the advantage is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Pope's ſide: for as he cannot make ſtakes, he hazards nothing; but if Trump ever turn of his ſuit he bids fair for all. <hi>Defende me gladio, &amp; ego te defendam calamo,</hi> peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was no ſuch unequal offer. Beſides, they may poſſibly have the art to turn his credit to their advantage, and make uſe of it to keep their Subjects more obedient and more in aw. It may be they have ſome of them no better original Title to all, or part of their dominions than his Authority, and then a blind man may ſee what reaſon they have to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. It may be theſe, it may be other reaſons ſway with them; but whatever they are or may be, I think 'tis plainly hatching a ſerpent in their boſoms. For let us ſuppoſe the Pope and a Catholic Prince at ods, a thing ſo far from impoſſible, that 'tis not unuſual. 'Tis in his power, you'l ſay, to continue Catholic whether the Pope will or no, and then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:8"/> He's ſafe, for he gives the Pope no hold, it being only He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie upon which he can faſten. But is this true, that nothing will do it but plain Hereſie? Has not <hi>Zecchius</hi> taught us that the Pope may deprive Princes of their Kingdoms as oft as they do any great hurt in the Church? And will not the bad example of contraſting ſtubbornly with the ſupreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor be interpreted a great hurt in the Church? Has not <hi>Franſciſcus Bozius</hi> informed us, that by reaſon of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Monarchy in all things, temporal Laws may be made by the Church, and Kingdoms taken away for juſt cauſes? If we ask what theſe juſt cauſes are! <hi>Santarellus</hi> anſwers, That <hi>Princes may be puniſht and depos'd, not only for Hereſie, but for other cauſes; for their faults, if it be expedient;</hi>

                        <hi>if Princes be negligent, if their perſons be inſufficient, if unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> How few Princes are there who fall not under ſome of theſe qualifications, or at leaſt may not be judged to do ſo, when the Pope, and He their Enemy, is to be Judge? As certainly it were a crime greater than the greateſt of theſe, to ſeek the determination of theſe things from any elſe. This negligence, though, ſtumbles me a little, for it ſeems a general, and ſomething a captious word; and I think it would be to the ſatisfaction of thoſe who are concern'd, if it were defined as ſoon as might be, how many hours a day a King is to give audience, that he may not paſs for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. But the man for my money is <hi>Thomas Bozius,</hi> who tells us plainly, That <hi>the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Jure Stat. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>6.</hi>

                        <hi>and Queen of the world, may as often as the order of the whole doth require, &amp;c. transfer the proper rights of one to another, as a ſecular Prince may caſt down private mens houſes for the beautifying the City, or impoſe tribute for the weal public; That he may thus juſtly do, although he hath not erred from whom ſuch rights are transferred to another; ſo the Pope gave the Indians to the Spaniards.</hi> 'Tis an honeſt fellow this <hi>Bozius,</hi> and cares not for mincing matters. Give me the man that ſpeaks out. But what think you, is Hereſie the only unkinging crime, when you ſee any great harm; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, inſufficiency, unuſefulneſs will do it? When inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it ſelf is no ſecurity, and the beſt King of the world may be turn'd out of his Kingdom, and that juſtly, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:9"/> be thought able to govern more handſomely? What handſome work will theſe Maxims one day make in the world, if they be ſuffered to take deep root? For my part I cannot ſee but Catholic Princes, as ſecure as you make them, are no leſs concern'd then Proteſtants to beware of them, and weed them up quickly and effectually. But is it ſo eaſie to ſcape the crime even of Hereſie? I doubt not, and am filthily miſtaken if this word Hereſie have not as comprehenſive a ſenſe, and be not of a nature as plyable as Popery amongſt us; and if managed with equal dexterity may not prove equally ſerviceable. The late King was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Proteſtant Religion, and certainly had never a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more unmoveably fixt in it than himſelf: And yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice made him paſs for a Papiſt, at leaſt inclin'd to Popery, do what he could, and by that imputation principally undid both him and the Kingdom. <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> was poſſibly as hearty a Catholic; yet all his induſtriouſly affected bigotteries, his great beads, and Friers weeds could never clear him from the ſtain of Hereſie maliciouſly fixt upon him, till he fell with a fate different from that of our glorious King, in this, that his Kingdom ſuffer'd more no longer, his own end was more private, being execrably murthered by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Paricide, whereas the barbarous injuſtice done to our King was heightned by the formalities of public juſtice. So that as far I ſee Hereſie is as dangerous as Popery with us, and as hard to be avoided. But let us conſider a little. <hi>Sancius</hi> has told us that it is to be held with a right Faith, that the Principality of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true and only immediate Principality of the whole World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this be right,<note place="margin">

In good Faith Sir, I cannot think otherwiſe, but if theſe men ſay true, your Catholic Princes, let them keep as fair as they will with the Pope, are all Heretics in their hearts.

But be it as it will, this anſwer which would juſtifie the innocence of theſe doctrines, by the ſecurity of Catholic Princes comes pitifully off; when inſtead of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it takes them quite away, which is a fine kind of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for it is plainly a much eaſier task to maintain by theſe doctrines that there is never a true Prince in the Chriſtian world, no not in thoſe whom you call Catholics, than it is to maintain the doctrines. And yet when all is done, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe neither. For our Prince and People are of the number of thoſe whom your Church takes for Heretics, and can expect no other treatment from you, than what you maintain belongs to Hereſie. Wherefore however your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Princes ſatisfie themſelves, I neither ſee how he can be ſatisfied of the fidelity of ſuch of his Subjects, as approve of theſe opinions, nor with what face they can pretend ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and protection from him, Pray think of this, while I paſs to what I put for a ſecond anſwer, and what I have ſometimes heard alledged.</p>
                     <p>Theſe opinions, will you ſay, are moot-caſes probably diſputed amongſt private men, in which the Church is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engaged nor concerned. Pray God this <hi>Church</hi> be not as ſlippery a word as either <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> Theſe men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:10"/> who thus magnifie the Pope certainly are not of our Church: and I believe Presbyterians and Fanaticks of all ſorts will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them too, ſo that even for pitty, and not to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels of them, you muſt needs take them into yours. But they who ſpeak ſo kindly of the Pope need not fear diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We ſee they are both acknowledged and eſteemed, and are all <hi>Capita alta ferentes.</hi> Now 'tis ſtrange your Church ſhould be unconcern'd in men whom you account Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and learned, and whoſe books come out with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, of thoſe whom your Church commiſſionates for that purpoſe. Me-things the Act of her Officers, acting by her Authority, ſhould be taken for the Act of the Church; Unleſs you will have the Pope paſs for one of thoſe careleſs Princes who deſerve to be depoſed for negligence, and be ignorant that his Officers abuſe their truſt, and licence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound doctrines, and this at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where a body would think ſufficient care is taken that nothing paſs which is not eſteemed Orthodox. Bring me a Book printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the contrary doctrine is maintain'd, and I will acknowledge there is ſome ſenſe in this anſwer. In the mean time let me give you a few inſtances, and thoſe at home, by which it may appear the Pope is ſo far from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and unconcern'd in theſe poſitions, that he approves and countenances them, and that both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the reign of King <hi>James,</hi> upon the occaſion of the execrable Powder Treaſon, the Oath of Allegeance was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the pious wiſdom of the Parliament, to ſecure his Majeſty and Succeſſors from the like attempts for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Superior of the Catholic Clergy, at that time was one <hi>Blackwell.</hi> He, after much and long debate of the matter with his fellow Prieſts, at laſt reſolved the Oath according to the plain and common ſenſe of the words, might with a ſafe conſcience be taken by the Catholics; and afterwards both took it himſelf, and, by his admonitions to Clergy and Laity recommended it to them as a thing both lawful and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The greateſt part of the Clergy, who repair'd to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> upon that occaſion, followed the reſolution of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:11"/> Superior; and had the Pope been either a little more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or a little more negligent, I think it had been better for you. But he was more vigilant than ſtood with your profit. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was then alive, and he writes a letter to <hi>Blackwell,</hi> perſwading him to make amends for his fault, which he compares to the falls of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> whereof one deny'd Chriſt, the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry. The Pope himſelf ſends a Breve to the Engliſh Catholics, and forbids the Oath; and when they remained yet unſatisfied, and made ſome exceptions of ſome wrong information, and the like, uſual in ſuch caſes, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the firſt Breve by a ſecond, and ſo utterly daſhes the Oath, that ever ſince the generality of Catholics have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it; and thoſe few, who continued conſtant in defence of the lawfulneſs of it, were look't upon little better than Apoſtates The great maintainer of it <hi>Withrington,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honeſt man, was ſo briskly proſecuted, that he was fain to take ſanctuary in a Priſon, and glad he ſcap't ſo. If after this theſe things muſt ſtill paſs for probabilities, probabilities are things in which I have been much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for I thought a man had been at liberty to take which ſide he pleas'd; but I ſee a man may as ſafely maintain Hereſie, as that ſide of theſe probabilities which diſpleaſes the Pope. Neither can I ſee how the blame can be taken from him, and caſt upon private men. For private men would have gon right enough, if He would have let them alone, and had not overſway'd them by his authority, and an authority ſo abſolute and merely ſuch, that neither He alledges, nor I could ever ſee any reaſon to conclude that Oath unlawful even in your own grounds.</p>
                     <p>In the year 47, when upon the interpoſing of the Army, under the command of the then Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> it was hoped the difference betwixt King and Parliament, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Kingdom might have been compoſed, and Catholics comprehended in the general ſettlement, in caſe they could vindicate their principles from inconſiſtency with civil government. Three Propoſitions were framed by the Catholics to that purpoſe, importing that the Pope or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:11"/> Church had no power to abſolve from obedience to civil Government, or diſpence with word or oath made to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or authoriſe any to injure other men upon pretence of their being excommunicated, &amp;c. The Prieſts were conſulted about the lawfulneſs of theſe Propoſitions. They met ſome of moſt orders amongſt them, and all agreed they were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Laity reſted in their judgment, and the moſt conſiderable of thoſe who were at hand ſubſcrib'd them. This was not very public, and at a pretty diſtance; and if it were known a body would think there was no great harm in it, unleſs it be made prejudicial to Chriſtianity for men to live with their neighbours as honeſt men and good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould do. But they thought otherwiſe at <hi>Rome.</hi> The vigilant old Gentleman there, who muſt be pretended igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what paſſes in <hi>Italy</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> got an inkling, condemned, whether the proceedings or propoſitions I know not (for he was ſo wiſe as to keep his cenſure to himſelf, and never let it ſee light) and puniſht ſuch of the Actors as were willing to be puniſht. I know of one, a principal one too, who was ſent beyond ſea, and there did penance in a houſe of his own Order for the grievous fault of having been honeſter than the Pope would have had him, and I preſume made good reſolutions of amendment; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a new man and a pious knave for the future: And I ſuppoſe the reſt did the ſame, unleſs chance, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſtubbornneſs excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

How truly has a learned man obſerv'd, that you have the choice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought either bad ſubjects at home, or bad Chriſtians at <hi>Rome;</hi> But you muſt feed upon the fruit of your own wayes.

                     <p>But take yet another inſtance, and that even at this time upon the Stage. Upon the reſtauration of his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Catholic Iriſh Clergy hoping to obtain the effect of ſome agreements made in the time of the troubles which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:12"/> the then Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> the King's Lieutenaut there, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated a certain perſon now living, and ſent him over into <hi>England</hi> to ſollicit thoſe pretenſions in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. And finding a profeſſion of Allegeance neceſſary to their buſineſs, they framed one which they ſent to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator to be made uſe of in their names, and is now in every bodies hands, and generally known by the name of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Remonſtrance. This Profeſſion not appearing ſufficiently authentick, the Procurator cauſes a meeting of ſuch of the Iriſh Clergy as were then at <hi>London,</hi> and informs them of the neceſſity of a general ſubſcription to it. One Biſhop, and three and twenty other very conſiderable men ſubſcrib'd it, ſome ſeven or eight held back, profeſſing yet the thing both Catholic as to the doctrin, and lawful as to the action; but asking what they ſhould get by it? But the game being once a foot it was preſently and hotly follow'd by the Popes Miniſters, Cardinal <hi>Francis Barbarin</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Nuntio at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Internunce at <hi>Bruxels</hi> interpoſe with all concern imaginable. They ſpeak, they write againſt it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it condemn'd before hand by two Popes (meaning the Brief of <hi>Paulus</hi> V. about the Oath of Allegeance, and the cenſure of the three Propoſitions by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw light) and prevail with the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> to cenſure it. They countenance, they encourage, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote he Diſſenters, and brand the Subſcribers with the odious names of Seditious, and Schiſmatic, and Heretic, and Apoſtate. One, and he a venerable man, was told to his face, He had better have died than ſubſcribed. But the greateſt buſtle was about the Procurator himſelf. Him they ſet upon with all Arts they tempt him with fair offers, and the promiſe of very conſiderable preferments: That failing, they perſecute him all they can; they make his Superiors (for he is a Religious man) cite and excommunicate him, all diffame him, and at laſt have brought things to that paſs, that few believe him a Catholic, and thoſe few keep their charitable thoughts to themſelves for fear of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the dangerous Contagion. So that ſo far as I can percieve, if the Subſcribers were the honeſter men,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:12"/> the Diſſenters were the wiſer. If theſe opinions muſt ſtill paſs for probable, about which Divines may buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without interreſting the Church, you have a ſtrange and unintelligible way of government amongſt you. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks probabilities ſhould have equal dealing, and Divines left to ſcuffle about them, as well as they can, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality on either ſide. So I think 'tis with your other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities in the hot diſputes betwixt the Jeſuiſts and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, Scotiſts and Thomiſts and the reſt. Let them beat the Pulpits as hard as they will, the Pope looks quietly on, lets them cool and take breath, and too't again, and this is fair play. But to depreſs one ſide, and cheriſh the other, and this vigorouſly and conſtantly, is ſomething odd for probabilities. In the name of wonder are Schiſm and Hereſie probable amongſt you, into which one ſide of your probabilities alwayes runs? Or is it an approv'd cuſtom amongſt you to excommunicate for probabilities? In fine, ſay what you will, I cannot think otherwiſe but that theſe probabilities of yours are as improbable as any thing in the world. Then for your other pretence, that the Church all this while interpoſes not: either all words univerſally have conſpir'd together to abuſe us, and make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing, even of the plaineſt, or there is no ſence in it. One would think that Church in Spirituals, is as ſtate in Temporals. Now if two Princes fall out, and the King of <hi>France</hi> for example, aſſiſt the one with council, and forces, and the endeavours of his Miniſters, we ſay uſually, and I think pertinently, that the State of <hi>France</hi> is engaged on that ſide, and he who ſhould deny it, would be thought deficient either in his language or his wits. For can a more pleaſant paradox be invented, than that an Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by commiſſion of the King of <hi>France,</hi> owning his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and He their actions, were all the while but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of particular men in whoſe doings the King and State are unconcern'd? Now for King ſay Pope, and for State ſay Church, and where is the difference? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as I am not much acquainted with quirks, and fear the ſubtle <hi>Diſtinguo,</hi> and the <hi>triccum de ſchold</hi> as much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:13"/> as the <hi>triccum de lege,</hi> I will not undertake but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many ſchool Phyſitians as you have, ſome Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical plaiſter may be found out, which you may apply to this ſore: But this I ſee that whatever effect a diſtinction may have in the <hi>Schools,</hi> it will do no manner of good in the <hi>world.</hi> For if the men of your Church perſecute other men, they will be no leſs perſecuted whether your Church do this as a Church, or under ſome other formality. The world is a material thing, and formalities alter not its ſettled courſe. Diſcredit, and want, and pain are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, and when they fall upon a man, he will be ill at eaſe in ſpite of all the belief formalities can afford him: And if material Subjects rebell againſt a material King, and drive him out of his material Kingdom, I think it matters not much what formalities there were in the caſe. I ſuppoſe he will be little the better by learning his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did not act as Subjects, nor treat him as a King, and his new acquaintance with thoſe ſubtle empty forms I fear will yield him ſmall comfort. If your formalities can preſerve or reſtore Kingdoms, if they can make honeſt men of Traitors, if they can reſtore the credit of private men, and relieve their wants, and eaſe their diſtreſſes, I ſhall acknowledge they are worth hearkning after: But if they can do none of theſe things, the Schools that invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, had even beſt keep them to themſelves, and much good may they do them. The world has neither need nor uſe of them, for real miſchiefs are not cur'd by verbal diſtinctions. We complain that the material Governor of your Church arrogates to himſelf a power dangerous to Princes, and that the material men of your Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in it, and both together hotly proſecute All who are not as hot as themſeves. Tell not me the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does this, but not as a Church; for as a Church, or not as a Church, ſhe does it; and if the miſchief be done, what matter is it how? <hi>Withrington</hi> ended his uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dayes in priſon; <hi>Walſh</hi> is in a fair way to the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: Thouſands of people were ruin'd, thouſands deſtroy'd in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> upon the conteſts betwixt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:13"/> the Pope and Emperor, in <hi>France</hi> upon the Holy League, and what happened in thoſe places may happen every where. 'Tis a remedy for theſe miſchiefs which I look after, and ſecurity that they ſhall not one day happen here, not the formality by which they were done: For in fine a formal plaiſter to a material wound, is but good words to him who is hungry. We had our formalities too, and our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions in the late war, and heard enough of the politic capacity, and the perſonal capacity; but they neither aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing of the publick miſery, nor the deſerv'd pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted on the witty Authors. Our Pagan Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries found them guilty for all their acuteneſs, and their ſophiſtry had no effect with the illiterate Hangman and undiſtinguiſhing Halter. We had the formalities of Juſtice to boot, but they ſerv'd for nothing but to render a fact execrable in it ſelf more barbarous and more inhumane. You may have more and other formalities, but after all they will be but formalities, and not a jot more uſeful than ours. You ſhall permit me to conclude with a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> which I would recommend to your ſerious thoughts. Either your Church it engag'd in theſe Poſitions, or ſhe is not; if ſhe be, ſhe is unexcuſable for holding them; if not you are unexcuſable for not renouncing them, when without injury to her authority or your own conſciences you may.</p>
                     <p>I would gladly receive an anſwer to this Paper, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a return, for I do not think any anſwer can be made. However I entreat you by all our friendſhip to let me know what you can ſay. Having found you both rational and ingenious in other points, you muſt needs ſatisfie the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity I have to know whether you will diſclaim your Church or your reaſon: for certainly you muſt make bold with one, and the beſt I ſuppoſe will be but a bad choice. As you are all brought up in a wonderful reverence to your Church, I know it will be hard for you to acknowledge any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in Her; and yet on the other ſide I think it will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hair of your temper to part with your reaſon, and, that you may be thought a good Son of your Church,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:14"/> be content to be thought no good man, as certainly he is not, whoſe actions are not warranted by his reaſon. Pray think not the worſe of my friendſhip that I put you to ſo hard a choice. Reaſon is the meaſure of friendſhip as of other virtues, and we cannot ſin againſt friendſhip by acting according to reaſon. Beſides, Friend, you live in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion diſapprov'd by Law, and unmaintainable by Reaſon; and I think 'tis the part of a friend to tell you ſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once again pray think not the worſe of me, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that whatever you think I truly am</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Received your long Letter, with the obligation you lay upon me to anſwer it, and heartily wiſh you had made uſe of the power you have over me in ſome other occaſion. This ſubject is a kind of Candle to Flyes, with which if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to play, they have great luck if they do not burn their wings. You are at your eaſe, and may freely talk at pleaſure, ſecur'd by the Laws, and at defiance with the Pope. The caſe is otherwiſe with us, who believing of the Pope as we do, and ſubject to the Laws as we are, can neither be without reſpect for him, nor apprehenſion of them, and though we could ſpeak even clearneſs it ſelf, 'tis all to nothing but we fall foul on one of the Rocks. Notwithſtanding, ſince I ow much to your friendſhip, I would gladly preſerve, if I can, your good opinion both to my ſelf, and Religion, of which you ſpeak ſo charitably, and nothing like an enemy, and beſides, would not be guilty of her ſhame by confeſſing ſhe has nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, nor of my own by continuing in an unjuſtifiable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; I obey you with this requeſt, that you will take care to preſerve me from the hazard I run by ſerving you, and let this Paper be ſeen by none but ſuch as mean as well as you and I. Firſt then I am ſo far from thinking our friendſhip ſhockt by your free proceeding, that I take my ſelf and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion both obliged to your candor, and wiſh from my heart I may as well juſtifie her, as you have your friendſhip. And for my Church, there are ſo few who look upon her with equal eyes, that this pity of yours, as juſt and charitable as it is, is yet more rare, and I cannot ſee it without as much acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment as ſatisfaction. And yet, as ſtrongly as you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe every where, I think you have reaſon no where more than in this particular. For ſo it is: if we ſay nothing, and, when we are often and loudly provoked to ſpeak, ſtill hold our tongues, we have a bad cauſe, and ſuch, for which nothing can be ſaid; if we ſpeak, we are inſolent, and cannot keep our ſelves quiet when we are well. And after all, 'tis the Combat betwixt the Knight and the Giant ſtill, as you have rightly obſerved. But the world is the world, where Reaſon, as much
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> our nature as it is, cannot hinder, but Chance, and Intereſt, and Paſſion, and ſeveral humours to which men are ſubject will have their ſhare in the conduct of things. Wherefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out complaining farther of what complaints are not likely to remedy; I think it beſt to addreſs my ſelf to my defence.</p>
                     <p>And the firſt point of it ſhall be to declare I mean not to defend any of thoſe opinions which you have alledged with ſo much ſharpneſs, for in truth I think them not defenſible, and that there is not more ſharpneſs than juſtice in what you ſay. Not but that to own, who would take the pains to peruſe the Authors you have cited, ſome of thoſe Sayings poſſibly might not appear ſo ugly as they do in your Paper. For there is a great difference betwixt words taken as they lie in the whole Context, and ſingled out from their fellows, who might peradventure to ſome of them afford ſome tolerable explication. But beſides that I conceive that labour not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for my purpoſe, I have no kindneſs at all for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and not enough for the Authors to prevail with me to undertake it. I have heard from thoſe who meddle with Controverſie, that their greateſt difficulty often is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the credit of private men, whom, becauſe they are of the ſame Communion, they are ſo unwilling to affront, that they have much ado to preſerve the Church from the contagion of their Errors. As my nature is a little more blunt, I have no ſuch difference for them, and think it but juſt, that <hi>Qui per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git quae volt dicere, ea quae non volt audiat.</hi> Let them ſhift for themſelves on Gods name, or let thoſe defend them who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Maximes. For my part I hate them heartily, and think it but a prepoſterous Charity to be ſo tender for the credit of thoſe who betray the credit of the Church. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then for reaſon all you ſay againſt thoſe opinions; of which I think as ill as you can do, I yet conceive your reaſon fails in the inference you draw from them. That true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot teach Doctrines inconſiſtent with Government; That a Commonwealth is not ſafe in which ſuch Doctrines are either tolerated or conniv'd at; (that is, when they come to be inſtilled and get credit with the People; otherwiſe while they remain in the Schools, I ſhould think the danger not very great, for Kingdoms are not overturn'd by Syllogiſms:) Farther if you pleaſe, that the Doctrines you have produced
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:15"/> are ſuch Doctrines, I freely grant you: But that our Church does teach ſuch Doctrines I deny, and notwithſtanding all you have ſaid, if you ſtill preſerve your unbyaſs'd candor, hope to make the contrary very evident.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, becauſe with you I think my authority may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſomething, for you know I will not tell you a lye, you ſhall permit me to ſay ſomething of my own knowledge. I was born you know of Catholic Parents, bred up in Catholic Religion, and have lived ſome part of my time in Catholic Countries. I have been at their Schools, heard their Catechiſms, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, their Diſcourſes; and by the care of my Friends, and ſome pains of my own, think few of my condition more fully inſtructed in that Religion. I aſſure you faithfully I was never taught any ſuch Doctrine, nor ever heard the Church taught it. On the contrary, I have been bred up in this belief, that obedience to my King is not only truly a duty, but, a duty truly required by Religion, and this perſwaſion was ſo well ſetled in my heart, that I yet remember how great and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a horror the late Rebellion cauſed in me, when I was too young to judge otherwiſe of it, or any thing elſe, but as I found it contrary to the ſentiments which had been inſtilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. I have heard indeed of the opinions you cite, but as of extravagancies of bold men, and when I came to the age of judging of things my ſelf, found, that though they were held by men living in Communion with the Church, they had yet no warrant from the Church to hold them, nor any better ground than their own miſtaking reaſonings, and ſo continued to deteſt them by judgment as I did before by Education. Now this anſwer, which it ſeems you foreſaw, you have endeavoured to prevent, making uſe your ſelf of an Artifice of Rhetoric, to bar me the aſſiſtance of Logic; for you would perſwade me, that to diſtinguiſh the material Church from the formal, or the man from the Churchman, is an idle airy nicety, which is of no uſe in the World. But truly one of us is much miſtaken, for I think on the contrary, that nothing is more obvious, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more familiar, let me add, nor more neceſſary, and that even to your material world as you call it, which without ſuch diſtinctions would quickly run into confuſion. The World is made up of men, and men of ſeveral qualities. The ſame perſon is both a man, and a Rich and Proud man, a Powerful and an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:16"/> Angry man, and we ſee Wit and Ambition, Goodneſs and Ignorance, Learning and Fantaſticalneſs often coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a hundred ſeveral mixtures of ſeveral qualities united all in one material Man. Now conſider what fine work there would quickly be, if every one of theſe uſeleſs formalities, as you call them, muſt be chargeable with all actions; if Riches muſt be taken away becauſe the Rich Proud man has <hi>ſcorn'd,</hi> and Power becauſe the Powerful Angry man has <hi>wronged</hi> his Neighbour: if Wit muſt bear the blame of Ambition, and Goodneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the miſcarriages of Ignorance; and Learning the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Fantaſticalneſs. Reaſon is our very Nature, and yet I think there are few to whom Nature has not given Logick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee that we do not always act <hi>as</hi> reaſonable, and who are not learned enough to ſeparate the Animal from the Man. To ſpeak yet plainer, a ſevere Father, a harſh Maſter, do they not ſometimes uſe their Children and Scholars unreaſonably, and ſo as utterly to ſpoil them? A corrupt Judge, does he not pervert Juſtice, and render thoſe Tribunals, from whence men expect the relief of Injuries, the ſeats of Oppreſſion? What then? Muſt the Father, and the Maſter, and the Judge be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the faults of the Man, and none of theſe powers left in the world becauſe they have been, and daily are abuſed? I think you and every body will confeſs that this were unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and yet your Argument ſpares none of them. For 'tis all one to Children and Pleaders, if they be materially oppreſt and miſus'd, whether this be done by the fault of the Office or the Officer; and ſmall comfort it is to tell them that their Judges and Maſters acted in their caſe as paſſionate men, not as Judges and Maſters, for they remain oppreſt ſtill, and the formality relieves them not. Kings themſelves are men too, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the failings of Mortality. Our Country indeed has this, amongſt other things, to thank God for, that ſhe has been extraordinarily bleſt with good Kings: but Hiſtory affords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch elſewhere, as have been unjuſt, and cruel, and tyrannical; And if you will not allow the King, and his ſacred Function to be free from the aſperſions to which the Man is ſometimes liable; let me tell you, Friend, your Doctrine will be more dangerous and more inconſiſtent with Government than the Papal pretenſions. Now as in all theſe caſes, and a hundred more which happen every day, and every where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:16"/> teaches us to examine the formality from whence the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief proceeds, and endeavour to provide againſt that, and let the reſt alone, ſo I think it ought to be in the caſe of the Church. We condemn not Learning, becauſe ſome learned men are fantaſtical, nor Riches for the pride of rich men, why muſt the Church be condemned for the fault of Church-men? Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Goodneſs, and Wit are not blemiſht by the errors of thoſe who have them; the Power of Fathers, and Maſters, and Judges is, and muſt be preſerved in the world, however Severity and Covetiſe daily abuſe it: and if this be ſo in all the reſt of the world, can you think it reaſonable the Church alone ſhould be exempted from the general rule, and be more anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the faults of thoſe who live in her communion, than Authority for the faults of bad men in Authority? The faults indeed ſhould be taken away, but the Church let alone. And truly had your Reformation as you call it, gone no farther than to retrench abuſes, ſuch as theſe you mention (and who knows but there may be other?) I might peradventure have call'd it ſo too: But inſtead of abuſes to take away Office and all, and defie the ſupreme Paſtor of the Church, and alter the whole face of Religion, there by your favour you reformed a little too far. For the ſame Logic which makes the Church reſponſible for the errors of Church-men, makes the Office reſponſible for the faults of the Officer, and that is to take all Offices out of the world, where men will be men, and liable to be reduced from the path of vertue in ſpight of all preventions poſſible in ſuch a nature as ours. I hope by this time that diſtinction does not appear ſo airy, and uſeleſs as you imagined: you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to add, that poſſibly you are no leſs concern'd in it than We. For we are not the only men; amongſt whom Principles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Government may be found. Remember who they were that ruin'd <hi>England</hi> by the late War, and were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things, which to dilate were as unſavoury as needleſs. They were ſo far from Popery theſe men, that fear of Popery was a chief Engine employed in the miſchief. Sad fate, by the way, and prepoſterous wiſdom! to deſtroy our ſelves for fear of being deſtroyed, and run into Fire and the Sword for fear of Ink and Paper. Neither is <hi>England</hi> the only example: <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> have felt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:17"/> lamentable effects from the Doctrines of men who would take it for an imputation to have learnt any thing of the Pope. So that it is very plain, that the Papal is neither the only, nor the only dangerous King-depoſing power in the world. 'Tis as plain that theſe men are neither Infidels, nor of our Church, ſo that you muſt even exerciſe your Pity too, and take them into yours. Or if pity will not prevail, I hope at leaſt you will take care ſo to defend your Allegiance, a not to overthrow your Church; And unleſs you make your Creed conſiſt but of Eleven Articles, I ſee not how you can diſown the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe men; for 'twill be a ſtrange Catholic Church which communicates neither with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Wherefore if your Argument be good, and Religion muſt anſwer for the faults of thoſe who profeſs it, there is no remedy, but Princes to be ſecure muſt baniſh all Religion, and People turn Atheiſts to be honeſt men and good Subjects. Now whatever anſwer you would give to one who ſhould charge ſuch wicked principles upon your Church, becauſe they are maintained by numerous, and learned, and famous men amongſt you, the ſame I give for mine. I believe for all your Pique to formalities, you would go near to diſtinguiſh your Church, or <hi>Believing</hi> men from the <hi>Erring</hi> men, and ſay you communicate with the Men but not with the Errors: So you ſhall permit me to ſay for mine, and this farther, that whatever you ſay, you muſt of neceſſity either condemn your ſelves, or abſolve us.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not that the force of your Argument drives me to that way of anſwer which I have choſen; it being eaſie to ſhew the Churches innocence even in your own way, and without the help of your diſliked formalities. Your Argument in ſhort is this: Learned men in the Church hold wicked Doctrines, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church holds them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If that Argument be good, this likewiſe of neceſſity muſt be good: Learned men in the Church hold thoſe Doctrines falſe and wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the Church does ſo too, for the ſame authority cannot but have the ſame force either way, and the Deniers have as much power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the imputation from the Church, as the affirmers to fix it upon her. You have cited, if not all, yet, the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thoſe who maintain them, and they make ſome ten or twelve. 'Tis pretty odd that the judgment of ten or twelve men
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:17"/> muſt needs be taken for the judgment of the Church: But let that paſs; by the ſame rule, the judgment of ten or twelve of the contrary muſt conclude the judgment of the Church for the contrary. Wherefore if I produce as many and as famous men for the Negative, as you have done for the affirmative, 'tis without more a do a drawn match, and nothing being proved either way the Church is abſolved by the Law of nature, by which every one is innocent who is not proved nocent. But what will become of your Argument if for one of your ſide I produce two, if ten, peradventure twenty on the contrary? Either you muſt confeſs the Argument has no force, or the Church inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence efficaciouſly proved by it, unleſs peradventure you can find ſome ſubtile formalities by which you will maintain your ſingle man is ſtronger than my ten or twenty. Now all this is not only poſſible, but already done to my hand by <hi>Caron</hi> the learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Iriſh Remonſtrance, who in his <hi>Loyalty aſſerted.</hi> what betwixt Canoniſts and Divines, Schoolmen and Fathers, Popes, Councils, Univerſities, Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c'</hi> has made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of more than two hundred and fifty Defenders of the contrary Doctrine. You ſee then I had no neceſſity of flying to Formalities to anſwer your Argument: For by your own Rule and Method the Church is proved not to hold the Doctrines you mention, and not only ſo, but plainly to hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nothing being more unreaſonable in the world than to give it with the ten againſt the two hundred; or to think that ten is a ſufficient number to engage the Church one way, and two hundred not ſufficient to engage her the other. But looking a little nearer unto it, me thinks it is of kin to <hi>Boccalin's</hi> Age, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geted four fingers thick with appearances. Strip off the gay Jacket of pretty ſmartneſs in which you have dreſt it, and there will remain as little ſubſtance, and leſs ſoundneſs. Learned men, ſay you, ſay ſuch things, therefore the Chureh ſays them. What if you be as much miſtaken in your Antecedent as Inference, and that they prove not learned who ſay them? Words, you know, are ſlippery things and you have well exemplified in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. I fear this term, Learned men, and Learning, is no leſs ſlippery, nor leſs abuſed than thoſe which are moſt ſo. But not to be too ſevere, a Divine is a Learned Man, can he therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Phyſic? The Metaphyſician, the Natural, the Moral
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106994:18"/> Philoſopher, the Mathematician, the Phyſician, the Lawyer, are all eſteemed learned men, but their learning is confin'd every one to his proper profeſſion; out of that, their authority is of no moment, and they may with all their learning be very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in matters which belong not to them. Now conſider a little, The men whom you have cited are, excepting one or two, all Canoniſts, and eſteemed able men in that profeſſion, but every one knows their profeſſion conſiſts in declaring what the meaning of the law is, and what the intention of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and if they go beyond this, they exceed the bounds of their profeſſion. Our Queſtion now, whether the Pope have, or have not, ſuch a power, to what skill does it belong? To the Law? Plainly nothing leſs. What the Pope has Commanded, and what he meant by the words in which he has expreſt his commands, is as far as the Lawyer can go; but what power he has to command, and how far that reaches, is quite out of his Sphere. If I miſtake not, for 'tis a ſtudy in which I have no skill, the power of the Lawmaker is a Principle ſuppoſed, not proved in the Law; for if a Lawyer go about to prove it, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the limits of his own Art, he argues <hi>a poſteriori</hi> thus, He has commanded, ſuch and ſuch things, therefore he has pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to command them. And this is a proper, and good law proof, where the firſt Maxim is, that the Law is juſt, and the power of the Law-maker ſtill ſuppoſed. If the Lawyer venture upon other proof, he intrenches upon anothers skill, in which poſſibly he may be very ignorant. And he that will not be ſatisfied with this, nor admit his other Maxim, <hi>Lex non facit injuriam,</hi> but excepts againſt Law and Power, and all, has no remedy but to ſeek ſatisfaction elſewhere. In fine, what the Pope claims from Chriſt, belongs to the Divine; what from Reaſon and the force of Nature to the Philoſopher: only what he claims to the agreement of men belongs to the Lawyer, and in this he ought to be heard, in other things he is <hi>Sutor ultra crepidam.</hi> Your diſcourſe therefore, which appears ſo trim and gay in the dreſs you have given it, has no more ſtrength than the authority of a few men in a matter wherein they have no authority, and if they had, is overpowred by a greater, and this methinks you need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not have thought ſo unanſwerable.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:18"/>
                     <p>Were you now an Adverſary with whom I ſhould think fit to uſe the Right eſtabliſht by the Laws of diſputation, I ſhould ſay no more; for an Anſwerer has fully diſcharged his part, who has ſhewn his Opponents Argument concluding. But ſince we are Friends, and write, not to convince, but inform one another, I ſhall return to my old way, which I take to be the way of Nature, and endeavour to ſhew you more minutely how unreaſonable it is the Church ſhould be charged with thoſe errors. Church ſignifies a Congregation of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Faithful Men who have Faith, And ſince Men, cannot be without Reaſon, nor Reaſon without working in them, 'tis unavoidable that beſides the perſwaſions lodg'd in them by Faith, men will have others which proceed from their Reaſons; to ſay nothing of Paſſion, and the Animal Nature. which has its efficacie upon the Faithful as well as all the reſt of mankind. Now as in the reſt of the actions of men, Nature forces us to look into the Principles from whence they proceed, and attribute every one to his proper cauſe, which if we did not, all would preſently turn into confuſion: So we muſt here, and conſider in the actions of the Faithful. Whether they act as Faithful, or as Men. And thoſe Actions which proceed, not from Faith, but Reaſon or Paſſion, are no more to be charg'd upon the Church, than the Covetiſe, or Cruelty, or whatever faults of men in office upon their Offices. And in all this there is ſo little ſubtilty, that every body does the like almoſt in every occaſion. There remains only to examine upon what Principle thoſe who aſſert theſe errors proceed, whether upon Faith, or ſome other: Faith is a reliance upon ſome Authority, and in our caſe, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, who alone is acknowledged the Author and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer of all which we are to believe. Wherefore of any point in queſtion, it muſt either be pretended that it was revealed by Chriſt or it cannot be pretended that it belongs to Faith; and if any maintain it upon other grounds, ſo far he acts, not as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but as otherwiſe qualified. Now there are in the world two principal ways, by which claim is made to the Authority of Chriſt; for that which we maintain is Faith, and that wherein we do not engage his Authority, neither of us ſay is Faith, or that they act as faithful, who upon reaſon, or experiment, for example, maintain any thing. The World hopes from the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:19"/> learned induſtry of the Royal Society the ſight of many truths yet hidden from her: but all their endeavours can never make Faith of them, nor concern your Church in them, as conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of it as ſome of them are. For they go not your Church-way of Faith; They look, not into Scripture, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and act as Learned, not as Church-men. What they ſhall diſcover to the World will be revealed not by Chriſt, but by them; and if any believe them, they will have no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but Society-Faith. Such is the caſe of our Church. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in her known method, by which ſhe pretends to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt. If any will run upon their own heads, and diſcourſe and maintain things, and never look into her Rule; She can be no more concerned in their proceedings than the Church of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe of <hi>Greſham Colledge.</hi> For ſince Faith is that by which ſhe is a Church, and Tradition that by which ſhe comes to Faith, people muſt engage Faith if they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Church, and Tradition if they will engage her Faith. Wherefore whoever goes about to prove any thing otherwiſe than by Tradition, uſes not the method to come to Faith I mean, the method approved by our Church, and this concluſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe, neither reaches Faith, nor aims at it, and by conſequence cannot belong to the Church or Congregation of the Faithful. Now reflect a little upon your Authors, and ſee if they go this way to work, and the firſt thing is the conſent of the preſent Age; for Tradition ſignifying the conſent of all Ages, 'tis a madneſs to pretend it for that which is not believed ſo much as by the preſent. Do they, or can they even offer at this while they ſee themſelves contradicted, by men as learned, and farr more numerous? While all the Univerſities of a great Kingdom diſapprove and condemn their Doctrine, and their Books are burnt in the face of the World by public Juſtice, and the men who do this acknowledged good Catholics all the while? Do they, or can they pretend the conſent of former Ages, while they know all Antiquity agrees, that for many Ages Popes were ſo Supreme in Spirituals, that in Temporals they were Subjects? Such they acknowledged themſelves, and as ſuch the Emperours treated them. When and how, and upon what occaſion they came to be temporal Princes is known to all who are, knowing in Hiſtory: A condition, by the way, which he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:19"/> who envies them, little underſtands, or little loves the good of the Church, with which 'twas much worſe when Popes were hindred from doing their duty by the unjuſt violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of powerful men amongſt whom they lived, Do they alledg the undoubted Teſtimonies of the Fathers of the Church aſſembled in a general Council? Nothing of this appears in what you have produced. The men themſelves are moſt of yeſterday, All, many Ages ſince Chriſt; and there needs no ſecond Argument to prove any thing that it is not Faith, if it can be proved that it began in any Age ſince the firſt, as theſe opinions plainly did. But conſider their Arguments. They are either grounded upon ſome odd interpretation of Scripture, as the order of <hi>Melcheſedech,</hi> the two Swords, St <hi>Peters</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the water, and the like; or elſe upon ſome deduction and reaſoning as weak as the water which they mention. And this methodt though <hi>per impoſſibile,</hi> it could prove the thing true, yet could never prove it to be Faith, There are many things in the world which are ſo acknowledged to be true, that they are withall acknowledged not to be Faith. Was it taught by Chriſt; Was it believed by Chriſtians, <hi>Semper, &amp; ubique, &amp; ab omnibus?</hi> Till this appear, it neither is, nor can be Catholic Faith: But that which I inſiſt upon is, that this method is plainly reſolved into Reaſon, and can no more engage the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the experimental learning of the Royal Society the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Authors you produce rely not upon the Authority of Chriſt, teſtified by an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conveyance down to us, but upon the ſtrength of their own diſcourſes, which if they be weak and fail, the Church never undertook that all in her Communion ſhould diſcourſe ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Neither can ſhe herſelf do more then teſtifie of the truths delivered to her, and they are ſuch, and were ſo delivered. This teſtimony is all which can be expected from her as a Church, (ſpeaking of what concerns us to ſpeak of; her power to make Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and the like, are no part of our caſe.) if ſhe fail in this, and either teſtifie that to be delivered which was not ſo, or ſuppreſs any thing which was delivered blame her; but for this, that ſome Members in her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have weak Reaſons, or ſtrong Paſſions, if you blame her, conſider the confuſion you will bring into the World, which I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:20"/> have ſo much dilated before, that to repeat it would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here.</p>
                     <p>But will you have a taſte of the Churches ſenſe of theſe things? Conſider the Hymn made in the firſt Ages of the Church, inſerted ſince by public Authority into her ſolemn Office, received by all the Faithful, and uſed on the Feaſt of the <hi>Epiphany. Non eripit mortalia qui Regna dat coeleſtia.</hi> Can the Church, which prays thus, be thought to favour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing power? Or can her ſenſe appear more plainly, than in the conſent of an univerſal practice? But let us look upon her in a Council. <hi>Wickleff</hi> amongſt other errors had advanced this Propoſition: <hi>Populares,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>The people may at their pleaſure correct their offending Lords,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Con. Conſt. Seſs. <hi>8.</hi>
                        </note> And this amongſt the reſt was condemned by the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> To the ſame Council was offered another Article worded in this manner: <hi>Quilibet Tyrannus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Every Tyrant may and ought lawfully and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly be killed by any of his Vaſſals or Subjects, even by ſecret plots and ſubtle inſinuations or flatteries, notwithſtanding any Oath or League made with him, not expecting the Sentence or command of any Judge whatſoever.</hi> This they condemned too, and hear if you pleaſe in what terms: <hi>The Holy Synod, deſirous to riſe up againſt this Error,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Seſs.</hi> 15.</note> 
                        <hi>and to take it wholly away, declares and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines this Doctrine to be erronious in Faith and Manners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and condemns it as Heretical, Scandalous, and giving way to Frauds, Deceits, and Lies, Treaſons, and Perjuries; Moreover it declares, and decrees that thoſe who pertinaciouſly aſſert this moſt pernicious Doctrine are Heretics, and as ſuch to be puniſhed, according to the Canonical Decrees.</hi> Behold the moſt exorbitant of your Doctrines directly and authentically condemned: And though I am not ignorant that ſome of them may find in the expreſſions as they lie in the Council, wherewith to evade her Cenſure, yet I conceive her ſence ſo clear, that thoſe evaſions can appear no better than evaſions. For 'tis a plain caſe, She takes Duty to Princes to be a direct point of Faith, ſince ſhe condemns the contrary of Hereſie; and ſince ſhe allows not even Tyrants to be kill'd, I conceive ſhe declares plainly enough againſt the depoſing power, whoſe chief ground is, that depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Princes are no longer Princes but Tyrants; for without doubt of all ſorts of Tyrants, thoſe are the leaſt ſuch, and have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:20"/> moſt title to the protection of the Council. (I beſeech you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me not, as if I thought my ſelf, ſuch Princes indeed were Tyrants, but I ſpeak in the Language of thoſe who think ſo, and I maintain they are Condemned by the Council, even though their impoſſible ground were ſuppoſed true.) And if her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are not ſo direct and formal as to avoid all cavill; The reaſon is obvious: Councils do not make Propoſitions to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but condemn ſuch condemnable ones as they find made to their hands. She condemned that Doctrine in the terms in which is was propoſed to her, and by her carriage ſhews what it is to expect from the Church in whatever terms it be propoſed. People may talk at random in the Schools, where 'tis propoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly thought a piece of learning to be able in the morning to defend one thing, and in the afternoon the quite contrary: but let theſe men and their learning appear in a Council, and they will go near to be askt, ſince they know that to give obedience <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitis etiam diſcolis,</hi> and that not only <hi>for fear,</hi> but <hi>for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> was taught by the firſt Maſters of Chriſtianity, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believed, and practiſed ever ſince, and <hi>ab omnibus,</hi> and <hi>ubique,</hi> and <hi>ſemper,</hi> by what warrant they bring in an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Rule eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, and tell us 'tis to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood if the Pope command not the contrary? They will be urged to produce their authority for this exception of theirs, to name the Father, that taught it, and Children that believed it: to make out its Univerſality both in Time and Place; and if they can do none of all this, as plainly they cannot, 'tis well if they ſcape the cenſure of Hereſie themſelves, who are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to fix it upon others. Subtilties, and the knack of talking, and the opinion of learning will avail them little where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rule is <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>not delivered,</hi> and <hi>not to be believed</hi> is all one. But I go too far, it being neither my buſineſs nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to diſpute the Queſtion. Thus much, when I was once in, I could not chuſe but ſay, and I cannot but add, that if the contrary to your doctrine be not ſufficiently defined already, it may be when Princes pleaſe, and in ſuch terms as they pleaſe, when ever they think fit to uſe their intereſt for the calling of another General Council. In the mean time I conceive there is never a King in Chriſtendom, who has not credit enough with the Clergy of his own Dominions to cauſe them to condemn
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106994:21"/> thoſe opinions. All the Univerſities of <hi>France</hi> have done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and I preſume no Catholic Church-men, if they were required by their Prince would refuſe to follow their example. Mean time what belongs to me is, that thoſe opinions are not Doctrines of the Church, ſince they do not ſo much as pretend to the only Rule by which ſhe judges of Doctrines, and their only grounds are private deductions of private men, with which if the Church ſhould be charged, and Faith made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for the miſcarriges of Reaſon, it would be an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice whoſe conſequence would quite invert the order of the World, and leave neither Church, nor Prince, nor Magiſtrate, nor Policy, nor Oeconomy on Earth.</p>
                     <p>But if this be ſo, how come ſo many men eſteemed learned to aſſert ſuch extravagances, the Pope to allow them, private men to endure them? I anſwer, how can it be otherwiſe, while men are men, and the World the World? Popes are men, and have long time both been, and lived in the State and ſplendor of Princes. Can it be thought ſtrange, if Flatterie have found acceſs to a Court, and amongſt ſo many, if ſome have given ear to it? They are generally very good men, but of late better verſed in Polities, that Divinity. For the moſt part they are well skilled in the Law, eſpecially the Canon, an uſeful knowledge for Church Government, but for Divinity they uſe or relie on others. And if men who paſs for able Scholars, and great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines flatter them with an addition and power, and tell them it truly belongs to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they can and will maintain it; Can you, who think Miracles are ceaſed, wonder they ſhould be content it be thought true? They ſee many who oppoſe it, are their profeſt enemies, and if it be perpetually incultated to them, that the reſt have got a tang of that enmity by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them, how can it be but they will be perſwaded of it at laſt? Wee ſee the often repetition, even of known lies, cheats the teller at laſt into a belief of them. And if once they come to be perſwaded the thing is true, it were wonder they ſhould not diſcountenance thoſe who oppoſe it, and cheriſh thoſe who maintain it. Then if one Pope declare any way, the reſt will all go on the ſame road, unleſs ſome very extraordinary action ſtop their journey. They underſtand the Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very well, and ſee that if one Pope ſhould undoe what his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106994:21"/> Predeceſſor has done things would ſoon fall into diſorder. So that they are ſlow, but very tenacious in their reſolves, and 'tis the hardeſt thing in the world to get them to alter their courſe, And all this is ſo far from ſtrange, that it were ſtrange it ſhould be otherwiſe. Then for learned men; conſider how much Eccleſiaſtical Promotions depend upon the Pope, and what plenty of means he has to gratifie all who appear for his intereſt. While one hopes for a Canonry, another a Biſhopric, another has the dazling purple glittering in his eyes; They will all be apt to ſay what they think will pleaſe him in whoſe power it is to ſatifie them all. And as the Schools go now it is not hard to ſay almoſt any thing, As men are of ſeveral tempers, I will not deny but ſome may be truly perſwaded of your Doctrines and defend them with an upright conſcience, thinking that to exalt the Pope is truly advantageous to Religion, and beneficial to the World: But I believe you will not find many ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Thoſe you have named, are ſome the Popes own Subjects, moſt Italians or Spaniards, upon whom He is known to have particular influence, and if we judge that in this exalting the Pope, they might have an eye to the preferment of themſelves, I think it will be no raſh judgment. Of latter times thoſe have appeared the chief ſticklers in this quarrel, who are thought to have the greateſt dependance upon <hi>Rome,</hi> So that of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and produceable in behalf of thoſe opinions, I deceive my ſelf if the number be not ſhamefully inconſiderable, againſt whom there lies not a juſt ſuſpicion of intereſt, and of whom it may not reaſonably be judged that Hopes or Fears, or ſomething beſides pure Conſcience ſwayed their judgments: And Intereſt, you know, is a juſt exception againſt a Witneſs in all Courts. As for private men, what would you have them do? Conſider that all Catholics look upon the Pope as the chief Biſhop in God's Church, and ſupreme Paſtor of the whole Flock. If they hear any thing ſaid over-laſhingly of him, can it be expected they ſhould be forward to ſpeak what they think, til a due occaſion urges them? Or have leſs reſpect for him, than common civilitie uſes to every body? For when any thing is ſaid advantageous to a perſon with whom we converſe, if we believe it not, we keep our thoughts to our ſelves, and think it rudeneſs to oppoſe it to their faces. Beſides,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:22"/> as I ſaid at firſt, this medling of private men with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Princes, is the Flies playing with the Candle. <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> quite burnt his wings; <hi>Walſh</hi> has fairly ſing'd them; and if people learn warineſs by the harms of other men, I conceive they are not blameable. As frightful and threatning as the Idea is, which you have made of this danger, no Prince, that I know, thinks it great enough to deſerve that they ſhould interpoſe, and I think the man very fooliſhly wiſe who will pretend to underſtand their concerns better than themſelves, or better know what is fit to be done. People of our private Sphere, ſee but one thing; Princes ſee that one thing in likelihood better than we, and a hundred more of which we never dream, and till they ſtir themſelves, for private men to obtrude their politic Ignorance upon them is ſo far from laudable, that it is well if it be pardonable; neither will their forwardneſs ſignifie more than an over buſie diligence, and peradventure ſaucy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs. The old Monks wiſe counſel, <hi>Sinere res vadere ut vadunt,</hi> is as neceſiary in the world as a Cloyſter. Beſides, for Engliſh Catholics in particular, they have ſomewhat more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to keep ſilence, while their ſpeaking is ſure to be diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced on the one ſide, and not ſure to be protected on the other. You may perceive by <hi>Caron's</hi> Collection that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are, ſo much mealy mouthed men towards the Pope when there is fit occaſion to ſpeak what they think, and God forbid that Forreiners ſhould be better Subjects than Engliſh men. I am ſure they were Catholics who declared in Parliament, that the imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> is, and, at all times, has been free from all ſubjection to the Pope. And provided the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> againſt ſuch abuſes as were then found inconvenient, And they were Catholicks who refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal this Statute in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when other Laws made againſt the Popes Authority were taken away. But if you will have a touchſtone of the fidelity of Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, look a little upon the year 88. The Pope had ſtretched his Authority as far as it would go, and proceeded to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Depoſition and Abſolution of his Subjects from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her, down right Commands to aſſiſt her Enemies; and this Authority was backt by the Power of a great Prince, in their thought and language, invincible. Beſides, the Title of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:22"/> Queen born in time of a Marriage declared lawfull by the Pope was not free from diſpute, which carried the inclination of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics to the Title of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince happily introduced, and which I hope will long happily continue; and this was, if I miſtake not, the true reaſon of the jealouſie and ſeverity of thoſe times againſt them. Notwithſtanding the unuſual concurrence of ſo many and ſo great temptations, They ſtood firm in their Allegeance; and both our own and forrein Writers teſtifie, that neither the ſubtil Arts of the Politic Spaniard, or the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Popes Authority could prevail to make any Party here; but that the moſt learned and eſteemed of the Prieſts, by a ſolemn and authentic Writing, acknowledged the Queen, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe was excommunicated and depoſed by name, to have ſtill the ſame Authority and power as before, and as much as any of her Predeceſſors; and the Layty chearfully and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally offered to hazard their lives in defence of their Prince and Country, and that as private Souldiers, ther being too much ſuſpicion in the jealouſie of thoſe times to pretend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. In fine the Spaniards were ſo ill ſatisfied with them that the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> Admiral in that expedition, at his return, plainly told the Dutcheſs of <hi>Feria,</hi> an Engliſh Woman of the Family of the <hi>Dormirs,</hi> that had he prevailed, no difference had been made betwixt Catholics and others more than what the Sword could have found. Of later times the whole Nation is obliged to bleſs God for the happy fidelity of ſome of them, and we had ſtill been groaning under our late miſeries, if this traiterous Religion had not principled, even poor men into a fidelity ſtronger than the temptation of Gold. And 'tis not like the men, who act thus, would refuſe to ſpeak in fit occaſion. Things have been written, even ſince the return of his Sacred Majeſty which have been peradventure more zealous than ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but however which ſufficiently diſcover the inclination of Catholics to ſay all that can be expected with reaſon from them, when the conjuncture is proper. In the mean time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Dilemma you ſo earneſtly recommend to me, I muſt tell you it concludes not. We are inexcuſable, ſay you, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not thoſe Poſitions, when without injury to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Authority, or our own conſcience we may. Why ſo <hi>F A!</hi> is there no excuſe for an action but this, that 'tis unlawful? People
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:23"/> before they do any thing uſe to conſider the <hi>Why</hi> as well as the <hi>What,</hi> and examine not only whether the action be allowable, but whether it be convenient. But not to inſiſt on this, I will offer you a fair bargain. Do you your part, and I will do mine, make it reaſonable, make it fitting to do what you deſire, and I will do it. And that you may be ſatisfied I am in earneſt, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you faithfully to renounce theſe Poſitions as fully and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly as you can deſire, whenever you ſhall make it come to paſs that ſo to do is my duty, and not onely a bare gratification of your curioſity; and, in the mean time, aſſure you I heartily abhor them and alwayes did. The Child lyes now at your door <hi>F. A!</hi> If you truly deſire the thing ſhould be done, provide a good <hi>Why</hi> we ſhould do it. For my own part I tell you truly, I ſhall take it very unkindly if after this I paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſtill undiſtinguisht among thoſe whom you think deſerve ſuſpicion and diſtruſt; and ſince you have urged me to this Declaration, conceiving you are obliged to take care that it be not wholly uſeleſs. Pray let me put another Dilemma to you. Either your credit is great enough to preſerve us from the inconvenience of ſpeaking plainly, or it is not: If not, we are blameleſs, who are not forward to run into inconveniences to no purpoſe; if it be, 'tis you are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who urge us to an inconvenience which you can, but will not, remedy. Mean while to be ill lookt upon and ill treated, if we make our ſelves appear honeſt Catholics, and not ſo much as have protection for being Catholics, is to be acquitted of Burglary, and found guilty of Felony. Methinks it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unreaſonoble to make the maintenance of pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the ground why we should be liable to punishment, and keep us every jot as liable if we diſclaim them. Not but that we are very ſenſible of our preſent quiet, and bleſs and pray for the merciful Authors of it: But yet the Law is the Law ſtill; And it is very uneaſie to have no better ſecurity either of Eſtate or Life than a bare ſtop to the courſe of the Law, which may be removed at pleaſure. For my own part, as I am but <hi>John Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſo I hope 'tis a modeſt and pardonable ambition, if I wiſh to continue ſo with ſecurity. And ſince an extravagance in others, which I cannot help, may make you jealous even of my Frock and Cords, I shall gladly Endeavour to cure that jealouſie by any remedies which Reaſon can preſcribe, or Honeſty take. But
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:23"/> till you can procure thus much favour, to urge a teſtimony of honeſty ſo ungrateful to him, to whom we owe, and muſt pay a fitting reſpect, and when we have given it, to continue us ſtill in the condition of Knaves, is hard in it ſelf, and harder from you who have profeſt ſo often that you puniſh not for Religion, but Treaſon. Religion indeed is the moſt comfortable cauſe of ſuffering, and that which if I muſt ſuffer, I would chuſe; But yet ſuffering is ſuffering ſtill, let the cauſe be what it will; And though I eſteem Patience very much, and deſire the Vertue with all my heart, I know not why I ſhould deſire the occaſions to exerciſe it, and believe it is better not to need live Pigeons than to have them.</p>
                     <p>Coming to review what I have writ, I find the haſty courſe of my pen, intent upon the main body of the diſcourſe has paſt over ſeveral branches, which deſerve to be particularly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. As when you ſay, that ſo the miſchievous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines be allowed, it is all one whether they be allowed by the material Church, or the formal. To which I reply, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is very great. For were the Church truly engaged for them, there were no remedy, but either to own the Doctrines, or diſown rhe Church. But if ſhe be not engaged for them, as ſhe is not, one may deteſt the Doctrines, as I do, and yet remain in the Church. Again, when you make Church and State equivalent, I conceive the difference appears ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in what has been ſaid. State ſignifies a body of men united under ſuch a Government and ſuch Laws; and what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours do, the State is ſaid to do, for to the Governour it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to command in public concerns, to the reſt to obey. Church ſignifies a body of men living according to Doctrines and Laws eſtabliſht by Chriſt; and becauſe, as men, they cannot but have an act upon other Principles too, thoſe actions only and Principles which are derived from Chriſt, can properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church, in the reſt they are to be lookt upon as men, not as faithful, Beſides, you have produced ſome few who have the boldneſs to entitle thoſe Errors, as groſs as they are, to Faith and make the contrary Hereſie: To which I anſwer, There are a great many ſtrange things in the world, and peradventure few ſtranger than that men ſhould get the reputation of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet not know ſo much as what Faith is, or at leaſt the means by which it has come to us. The <hi>Regia Via,</hi> as Councils
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:24"/> call it, of Faith, is both plain in it ſelf, and plainly recorded in the Monuments of the Church, and that people ſhould think to come to it by their own little by-ways, and make Faith of that which is publicly and unreprovably contradicted by the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the preſent Church, and has no footſteps at all in Antiquity, and yet paſs for learned men, is a thing I have more diſpoſition to admire than unriddle, farther then in the ſhort hint I gave of the abuſe of that term by a wrong application. If ought elſe have ſcap'd my obſervation, by what I have ſaid, I preſume you will eaſily gueſs what I would ſay to it. Give me Leave to end with reflecting a little upon the difference there is betwixt theſe opinions maintained by the Adverſarys of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and maintained by her Members, For to flatter neither ſide, <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra.</hi> You communicate with depoſing-principled men, as well as we; though, thanks be to God, neither true Proteſtant, nor underſtanding Catholic communicate with the Principles. Now for our Church I have ſhewn why this extravagance of ſome of her members is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to her, and hope you perceive how unreaſonable it is that ſhe would anſwer for the deviations of thoſe who will not walk in her way, nor make uſe of her Rule. Some Popes indeed have behaved themſelves otherwiſe than I wiſh they had: But ſince they are Princes as well as Biſhops, I conceive it will not be thought ſtrange if all great men are not Saints, and if Humane Policy, and a deſire to encreaſe their greatneſs ſway with them as with other Princes. If they attempt upon the rights of others, Kings I hope know well enough that they bear not the Sword in vain, and can as well tell how to defend themſelves, and their Subjects from wrongs incident from them, as from other men; and ſure I am that Catholics are ſo far from being reſtrained by their Religion, that it obliges them to ſtand by their reſpective Sovereings, in defence of his juſt Rights againſt the Pope as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually as againſt any other. I could alledge that of thoſe Popes who have gone fartheſt, none has defined any thing concerning theſe matters in thoſe circumſtances, which even thoſe Divines, who attribute moſt to them, require as neceſſary to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> as they call it. But I conceive it needleſs, it ſeeming to me ſufficiently evident by what has been alledged already that our Faith and Church are not to ſuffer by theſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:24"/> exorbitancies; and commonwealths can ſecure themſelves by their own power. But Friend! the caſe is otherwiſe with you. Your men alledge Scripture for theſe errors, and engage your Rule of Faith, and how the honeſt Proteſtant (who in this caſe undoubtedly has the true ſenſe of Scripture on his ſide) can handſomely diſengage his Church from a ſcandal to which is pretended the authority of her Rule, is difficult to apprehend. If people come not to their journies end who refuſe to take the right road, it is no wonder to any, nor blame to the Guide, whoſe office it is to ſhew men the right way, but cannot make them follow it. But your men pretend they keep the way your Church ſhews them to Truth, and yet arrive at Error. And when Error and Truth pretend both to the ſame Rule, and that the Rule of your Church, I ſhould think your Church deeply concerned to conſider by what means it may be decided which is Hereſie, and which Faith. In ſhort our erring men, ſince they pretend not our Churches Rule, can never fix their errors upon the Church, nor advance them to Faith, nor beyond the degree of opinions: Yours, ſince they pretend to the very Rule owned by you, muſt needs, till a certain way of proceeding upon that Rule, or interpreting Scripture be ſetled, render it doubtful to thoſe, who truly deſire to be guided by your Rule, which of the two is the doctrine of Chriſt and are therefore wonderfully more dangerous to the Church than ours. Farther, abſtracting from Paſſion or Intereſt which may be equal in both; ours, becauſe they have no firmer ground than their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, are more reclaimeable, and may at any time relinquiſh their errors, without offering violence to their Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Yours, becauſe they pretend to your Rule of Faith, are apt to miſtake their miſguided Fancies for Religion (as we have ſeen in the late confuſions the title of Saints appropriated to wicked men) and ſo become fixt and unalterable in them? for which reaſon they are alſo much more dangerous to the State, as they were before to the Church. In this inequality of caſes, I do not know the Church of <hi>England</hi> has proceeded ſo far as ours in the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> or condemned theſe Errors by any Authentic Cenſure, though in my opinion it were proper for her to conſider how much her Rule, upon which depends her own ſtability, is concerned in them. Mean time, inſtead of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106994:25"/> reproaching our ſeveral Churches with the errors of their ſeveral Members; It were I think more to purpoſe. I am ſure more charitable, to endeavour that all Errors might be taken away on both ſides, that by one Faith and one Baptiſm we may all ſerve our one Lord and God, and reunite into one Holy, and Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, and Glorious Church, free from thoſe ſpots and wrinkles which our unhappy Diviſions have too too much, and too long brought upon her. This is what the deſire to obey your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands has ſuggeſted to me in anſwer to your Letter: You will pardon the length of it, which, as it is beyond my expectation, ſo 'tis beyond my power to remedy, and give me leave to hope it may prevail with you not to abate either your Charity to my Religion, or kindneſs to.</p>

                     <p>FOR all the thanks I owe you, and all the Complements 'twere fit I made you, take this acknowledgment, that you have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond my expectation; and this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that I will conſider very ſeriouſly what you ſay, and make ſuch uſe of it, that you ſhall have cauſe to think your labour not unprofitably ſpent. But yet I cannot but complain of the ſecreſie which you enjoyn me. I for my part am ſo well ſatisfied of your way of writing, that I cannot but think others will be ſo too, and that this ſhineſs of yours is injurious both to your ſelf and the World; and becauſe unjuſt commands are not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, let me tell you frankly I mean not to confine your Papers to my cloſet. They ſhall be ſeen if it pleaſe God, by more Eyes then mine; but yet not to fall abſolutely out with you, I will divide ſtakes, and ſo communicate what you write, that there ſhall be no ſuſpition of the Writer. This I promiſe you very faithfully, and to do it with more exactneſs, leſt your name ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, I engage my ſelf to conceal my own. Then if <hi>John a nokes</hi> get all the praiſe from you, the fault be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Head. For the reſt to deal plainly with you, I find my ſelf I know not how. Things will not ſettle with me, and though out of the mouth of a good Proteſtant, I believe what you ſay would have paſt good reaſon; yet when I reflect you are a Papiſt, that is, if you will pardon my Freedom, of a crafty inſinuating Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I have ſtill a kind of grumbling.</p>
                     <p>This Papiſt marrs all; and though I think my ſelf as free from prejudice as other men, I find t'wil not do. I can not but fear being trapan'd. You have I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſaid many things very well, and more then I thought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:27"/> you had been allow'd to ſay, but you are reſerv'd ſtill. 'Tis true you give Reaſons for your reſervedneſs, which I can not anſwer; but whether it be that my plain nature would have every thing as plain as my ſelf, or that curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be like Love where too much reaſon is thought blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I could wiſh in this occaſion you had us'd leſs Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and more Freedom. Speak out the whole truth, man, and be a good Proteſtant; otherwiſe own the whole Falſhood, and be a Papiſt of the firſt magnitude. I fear your half Catholicks are in as bad a Caſe as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taltos</hi> half Sinners, who ſhall be damn'd for not ſinning enough. For my part if I would be a Papiſt, I would be a Papiſt to purpoſe. Hang this motly Religion, this half <hi>Rome,</hi> half <hi>Geneva</hi> Faith, which gets a man neither credit nor ſecurity. I would be as good a Catholick as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> for his heart if I would be one; and if I thought your Catholick Faith would ſave me, I would take order mine ſhould be Catholick enough ſure, and never boggle at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhould be offer'd me. But to leave Jeaſting, let me tell you, though I know not how you will reliſh the Complement, you write ſo well that you muſt needs write again. I may poſſibly hereafter give you more trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, when theſe fluttering Fancies of mine are ſetled into a ſteady Judgement. I know not how ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory your Anſwer may prove when I have fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it: If it do not, I reſerve my ſelf the liberty to tell you ſo; and in the mean time conceive you could not chuſe a more uſeful Argument, then this of the Popes power. He was a man famous for wiſdom who,<note place="margin">E. <hi>Salisbury</hi> Treatiſe of mitigation, p. 20.</note> as I find cited in one of your own Authors, <hi>was long troubled that ſome clear explication of the Papal Authority had not hitherto been made by ſome publick or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Sentente; and this both that thoſe Princes, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, may be ſecure from the fear and ſuſpicions of continual Treaſons and Attempts of Aſſaſins; and thoſe Princes who do not acknowledge it, and yet deſire to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of their Subjects, may certainly know how far they may rely upon their fidelity in temporal matters, who differ from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:27"/> them in what concerns their Conſcience.</hi> Conſider beſides what confuſion, what Wars and Bloodſhed we find in Hiſtory upon the conteſts betwixt the Spiritual and Temporal Power. People diſtracted betwixt the fear of making Shipwrack of their Faith or their Fortunes, know not how to avoid either Hereſy on the one ſide, or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion on the other. If the World were once well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the juſt bounds of thoſe two Powers, and knew wherein they conſiſted, and how far they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſuch conteſts would either not happen, or if they did People would readily know which part to take. However it be, pray ſatisfie me at leaſt in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. The ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ſtance of your Anſwer conſiſts in this, that the Doctrines I objected belong not to your Faith or Church. But does not this belong to your Faith, That the Pope is the Vicar of Chriſt upon Earth? I think you would not take him for a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick who ſhould deny it. Now if Chriſt gave to the Pope the Power he had himſelf, ſince He without doubt had all both Spiritual and Temporal Power, how can you avoid being oblig'd, and that by an Article of your Faith, to acknowledge that the Pope likewiſe has all manner of Power, and may juſtly and lawfully do all thoſe things which your Letter calls the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fancies of private men. This Friend exceeds the bounds of probable opinions, and intrenches ſtrongly on your Faith. Wherefore you ſhall not deny ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my friendſhip or importunity an Anſwer to it. But anſwer ſo, if poſſibly you can, that theſe doubts or umbrages, or what you perhaps may find a better name for, then I can give a reaſon of, may trouble me no longer. Will you permit me to deal plainly with you? I ſuſpect you have ſaid more then you are allow'd to ſay, and more then I ſhould be allow'd to hold if I were of your Communion. The <hi>Jews</hi> ware not more zealous to make Proſelytes then you are; and what know I but you may have a deſign upon me, and ſay more what you think may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:28"/> induce me to think favourably of your Religion, then what your Religion gives you warrant to ſay. Let me therefore intreat you to ſay nothing but what a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick may unreprovably ſay, and what I may be ſecure ſhall not be he diſallow'd by your Church. And ſince I can promiſe you no other fruit of your labour, for I do not think you hope in earneſt to make a Proſelyte of me, accept the aſſurance I give you, that you ſhall at leaſt firmly bind to your Service,</p>

                     <p>YOU know the power of your friendſhip over me, and you make uſe of it. For ought I ſee mine is juſt the caſe of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-handed <hi>Tom Fool,</hi> whom that praiſe betray'd to ſo much labour, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd his dexterity had almoſt cripled him. Pray God my eaſineſs, or your importunity give me not one day more cauſe of complaint then he had. But ſince you will not be deny'd, 'tis beſt to obey you without more a do. For your unquietneſs I could laugh at it, if its deeper root did not give me too much cauſe of grief. As ſincere as you are you are prejudic'd Friend, and this unquitneſs of yours is the ſtrugling betwixt reaſon, which you plainly ſee, and a paſſion ſo ſecret that 'tis hid even from your ſelf, which hinders you from entertaining freely what you ſee. Not but that I know your candour well, and am enough perſwaded you are not conſcious of oppoſing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wilfully, and would be your Compurgator of ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. But thus it happens: Ever ſince the change of Religion, and the bad attempts of ſome Catholicks in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> heightned by the horrid <hi>Powder Treaſon,</hi> it has been perhaps the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the State, however the employment of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, to give bad impreſſions of Catholicks and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And this has been done ſo long, and ſo univerſally, and ſo vehemently, that ſince you find the effect of it, I may reaſonably judge there is none who has not his ſhare, and who has not found an <hi>Idea</hi> of Catholicks more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have been repreſented then what they are. As the Nature and circumſtances of men are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſome are fram'd to a ſweet uprightneſs, others to an unwayward croſneſs. Again ſome converſe much with good Catholicks, ſome with bad ones, ſome with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:29"/> none, and who have no other knowledge of them, but as they hear of ſtrange animals in <hi>Afric</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſo men are differently affected towards them: But I believe there is none who has not more or leſs of the bad <hi>Idea</hi> ſo much endeavour'd to be fixt upon them, and that no hearty Proteſtant can hear things ſaid to the advantage of Catholicks or their Religion without that unquietneſs at leaſt which you find in your ſelf. It were to be wiſht, and perhaps expected from the Charity of <hi>Pulpits,</hi> that the example of that wiſe and merciful King, againſt whom that Treaſon was plotted might have been followed, and the Innocent diſtinguiſht from the Guilty. But whatever might or ſhould have been, we ſee what is done, and you find the effect in your ſelf, whereof that you may not think reaſon the cauſe, conſider a little that while we paſs generally for ignorant ſtupid people, led blindly into all the follies to which our blinder Guides our Prieſts conduct us, you object craft and ſubtlety to me. Reaſon, Friend, is more uniform and more of a piece, and objects not ſo croſly. For what you ſay of our Jewiſh zeal of gaining Proſelytes, I muſt avow to you I am of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, and wiſh <hi>non tantum ſe, ſed etiam omnes qui audiunt hodie fieri tales qualis ego ſum, exceptis vinculis his.</hi> I am taught to love my neighbour as my ſelf, &amp; becauſe I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd the way in which I am is the way to Heavean, I wiſh every body would chuſe it. But if you think me a dangerous perſon for this, you muſt think Reaſon a dangerous thing, which he that fears to be trapand, let me tell you is more trapan'd by his own fears. You talk pleaſantly of half Catholicks, and motly Religion, but I think you expect no anſwer, and need not be put in mind, that Religion as ſacred as it is cannot hinder men from uſing their weak apprehenſions, and diſorderly fancies, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular deductions as well upon it as every thing elſe; and he that ſhall take all that for Faith, which every even faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man offers him, may too truly ſay <hi>inopem me copia fecit,</hi> and find perhaps at laſt that too much Religion has left him none at all. For the new trouble with which you threaten
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106994:29"/> me, I hope the more you examine my anſwer, the leſs cauſe of exception you will find againſt it. Nevertheleſs if you do prove diſſatisfy'd, I will endeavour, when I know why, to ſatisfie you as well as I can.</p>
                     <p>The noble Perſon cite was unqueſtionably a wiſe man, and his ſaying is a wiſe ſaying, and I am of his mind, and wiſh ſuch an Authentick definition made in this matter with all my heart. But Friend, I am no Pope to make one, and though I am perſwaded an Authentick definition of truth might produce very good effects, I fear an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diſpute might do as much harm. Thoſe two Powers like two boundleſs Seas, have ſometimes ſtrugled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in their unreſiſtable Waves buried multititudes of unhappy People. We may bleſs God we live in a calm; diſputes might raiſe the billows again, and who knows when they would be laid. I could ſpeak with Freedom to you, but ſince you talk of communicating what I ſay to others, conſider that one will miſtake igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, another pervert wilfully, a third deduce raſhly, and in a matter of this conſequence where our duty required by the Law of God is concern'd, all interpoſe eagerly, and the moſt ignorant being ſtill the moſt forward and full of noiſe; the great good you fancy by ſetting bounds to the two Powers, would prove clamour, and buſtle, and inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable confuſion, and if any miſcarriage-happen all will be imputed to the Author, who as innocent as he may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, can never yet acquit himſelf of medling with what he has nothing to do. No Friend, let us preſerve the Majeſty of Supream Powers in an awful diſtance, and ſubmit to them with the reverence of a quiet obedience, and not make them cheap by unſeaſonable diſputes. Princes and Biſhops are both ſacred, let what belongs to them be ſo too, and not toucht without the excuſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or obligation of duty. <hi>But People ſhould know how to behave themſelves when the two Powers are at odds.</hi> For my part I conceive this is a Caſe which may ſafely be left to Gods providence, and that thoſe who do amiſs, ſin more by Paſſion then Ignorance. Let a man truly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:30"/> mean to do well, and bring an upright Conſcience to he Action, and I believe he will not want as much knowledge as is neceſſary for him. This I ſee, that God being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of both Powers, it is not poſſible they ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but by an abuſe of the one, and that abuſe will be viſible enough; and when the caſe happens thoſe who do not want honeſty will not miſcarry for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In the mean time I ſhould be very ſorry to ſee the caſe happen, I will not contribute towards it ſo much as even to mention it. Obedience is the duty which God and my condition require from me, and in the performance of that I will endeavour to be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, and leave diſputing to thoſe who value the praiſe of a witty or ſubtle man, above that of a faithful and quiet ſubject. Beſides though I might poſſibly hit of ſomething more then is uſually ſay'd on the argument, which in my Opinion uſes to be treated lamely enough, yet I take it much to exceed the ſphere of my ability. In two words it is a queſtion which I neither could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently handle if I would, nor would if I could. But for your ſecond queſtion, ſince it trenches as you ſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Faith, and we are taught to be ready to give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any who demands an account of the hope in us, I ſhall obey the Apoſtle and you to my power. You tie me nevertheleſs to pretty ſevere conditions, for what is there, or can there be ſo plain which miſtaking zeal will not reprove? or what other remedy can I bring to ſettle your quietneſs then Reaſon, which yet I conceive to be be the very thing which cauſes it? The onely expedient I can find to ſpeak as you would have me is to ſay nothing at all, I mean of my ſelf, farther then to deliver, upon occaſion, may ſence of what others ſay, but anſwer your objection in the words of ſuch men of whom you may be ſecure they will run no hazard of reproof from our Church; and if your Reaſon can as well rectifie your ſelf as their Authority will juſtifie them, I hope you may at laſt be ſatisfy'd. Remember then if you pleaſe that I take not upon me to determine dogmatically what is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:30"/> true, and what falſe, but only to acquaint you what may by a Catholicek unreprovably be ſaid. Peradventure I have no reaſon to be diſpleas'd with the bargain, for dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſing being ſo much out of Faſhion in this age, it is a great deal more eaſie as well as more faſhionable to deliver what other men ſay to the point, then to handle and conclude the point it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But to your difficulty. <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by Catholicks to be the Vicar of Chriſt on Earth;</hi> and I acknowledge that he is ſo. From this you frame ſuch an Argument; <hi>What power Chriſt had, the Pope has; Chriſt had all power, therefore the Pope has ſo too, and this by an Article of our Faith.</hi> Before I anſwer, let me intreat you to conſider what work 'twould make if it were apply'd to Princes inſtead of Popes, which I think it may as well be. For if the Pope be the Vicar of Chriſt on Earth, Princes are the Vicars of God on Earth; and that I think is as good and reaches as far: And if his Vicarſhip im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a power to diſpoſe of Kingdomes, why will not their Vicarſhip import the power of the Keys? and why may not he, who purely upon the ſcore of Vicarſhip, comes to the Pope for a Title to a Kingdom, as well go to his King for Remiſſion of his ſins? If the Pope muſt be ſaid to have the temporal Power as well as ſpiritual, becauſe Vicar includes both, I ſee not how Princes can be deny'd to have the ſpiritual, ſince they have the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and are Vicars as well as he. This Doctrine would make brave work, and introduce a very pleaſant Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation into the World. But I forget that I am to ſay nothing of my ſelf. I muſt therefore undertake a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labour, and ſhew from other men that Princes are the Vicars of God; and though the unanimous conſent of every body might well excuſe me, for none that I ever heard of either doubts they are ſo, or boggles to call them ſo when the phraſe comes in their way, yet I muſt not break my bargain. Let us then conſider what this word Vicar ſignifies, and in ſuch plenty, or rather ſuch a multitude, for I wiſh the plenty were as great as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:31"/> number as we have amongſt us, we cannot ſure be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what a Vicar is. We ſee he is one who ſupplys the place of another, who not able for other reſpects to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his proper employment, delivers it over to be executed by him whom we call his Vicar. Kings we ſee govern the World, and the Government of the World being the proper work of Providence, they do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which properly belongs to God. But the nature of God being of that unſociable excellence, that we are not able to bear the immediate Rays of divine brightneſs, and converſe with him whoſe Face none can ſee and live, our nature requires he ſhould do this by ſuch ſubſtitutes to whom we may addreſs our ſelves, and have recourſe for what we need. Since Kings then ſupply the place of God, or do that which he ſhould do, and which he truly does by them, they want nothing to the perfect notion of his Vicars but this, that they be appointed and impowr'd by God for that end: With this difference notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Vicars are neceſſary for other men, from the imperfection of their natures who make them, becauſe they cannot attend to two employments at once; but are neceſſary for God from the ſuperexcelling perfection of his nature, and imperfection of ours, which cannot bear an immediate converſe with him. Now that they are immediately ſubſtituted by God to govern the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him or in his place, ſince tis not likewiſe to be deny'd, I hope a few Authorities will ſerve to prove. And yet I cannot tell whether that haſty word <hi>Immediately</hi> will down with all. For ſome Divines put this difference betwixt the Spiritual and Temporal Power, that the firſt is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, the ſecond by mediation of the People, ſubjecting themſelves by way of Election, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or ſuch other means by which Governments are either introduc'd or eſtabliſht. And for my part, though I were not ty'd from dogmatizing, <hi>irritare crabrones</hi> is a thing from which I have much averſion, eſpecially in a queſtion which I conceive of an extraordinary importance. For whether the power be from God immediately or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:31"/> mediately, ſo it be from God, I conceive it extends as far and is as much to be obey'd. <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were immediately appointed by God, and yet I think as much obedience was due to <hi>Solomon</hi> as either of them, and that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſour, whether <hi>Clemens</hi> or whoever elſe, was as much Pope as he. And if election made the power mediate, we ſee Popes are not Popes till they be elected. There are indeed who by this mediation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a reſerve in the people to reaſſume in certain caſes the power which they have given: But this I muſt needs think very abominable, and ſhall not ſtick to ſay whoever reproves me for it, is himſelf more reprovable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> has taught there is no power but from God; ſo I believe: and if any think they have found better Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Faith, I for my part mean to ſtick to thoſe which Chriſt has given me. But let us ſee what is ſaid by thoſe whom no Catholick I ſuppoſe will reprove. The Council of <hi>Paris</hi> ſpeaks methinks to purpoſe, when it ſays:<note place="margin">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:32"/> at ſubtletys, but methinks 'tis hard to make that power mediate, which is not from Anceſtors and Succeſſion, not from men, but from God alone. More refin'd wits perhaps may make it hang together that Kings have their power from God alone, and from ſomething elſe too, and that their power is mediate, in which none interpoſes but himſelf; and prove a gift from the people of that which God himſelf gives, as if his power were under Age, and could not make a valid donation without them: and when they have done ſuch fine things, we are ſtill juſt where we were; for 'tis acknowledg'd of all hands, even by thoſe who leaſt favour the temporal power, that it is from God; and if it be ſo, thoſe who have it from him are his Vicars.

I ſhall onely adde the Authority of the Roman Pontifical Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> 1595. where the Prayer appointed for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Kings ends thus, <hi>That you may glory without end with our Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> cujus nomen vicem<expan>

                        </expan> geſtare crederis, <hi>whoſe name you bear, and whoſe Vicar you are.</hi> This being ſo, conſider now what a pleaſant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you have light upon, by which Kings may as well abſolve Penitents, and confer Sacraments, as the Pope diſpoſe of Kingdoms. Notwithſtanding let us look a little nearer upon it. Chriſt, ſay you, <hi>gave all the power he had; He had all, both Spiritual and Temporal, therefore the Pope muſt have it too.</hi> If you will not be too haſty in your cenſure, but delay it till I have time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my meaning, I will anſwer you a Catholick may be a very good Catholick, and believe all a Catholick is bound to believe, and yet believe never a one of thoſe two Propoſitions. Not that I mean to be guilty of the blaſphemy of denying to the Son of God all power in Heaven and Earth, but that Son of God being man too, I do not know a Catholick is bound to believe that man, purely as man, was a temporal King. But of this more by and by when your ſecond Propoſition comes into play; in the mean time let us conſider the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt gave to the Pope in St. <hi>Peter</hi> all the power he had himſelf. Pray how does this appear? 'tis included ſay you in this, that he is his Vicar. I beſeech you conſider again, for I cannot readily think of an inference which ſeems to me more wild, and more palpably contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the open courſe of things with which we daily converſe. A Judge repreſents the Kings Perſon, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable does it, all Officers both Civil and Military ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place in their ſeveral employments. Can every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:33"/> one of theſe therefore do as much as the King? Can a General coyn money, or a Judge call a Parliament, or a Conſtable make War and Peace? We ſee their ſeveral Powers are bounded by their ſeveral Commiſſions, and the priviledge of repreſenting his perſon gives them no more power then he is pleas'd to confer upon them. How can it be otherwiſe with the Pope? He indeed is the Vicar of Chriſt, and repreſents his perſon, and ſo the Judge does the Kings, but what power he has we are to learn from his Commiſſion, not his Title.</p>
                     <p>Let us now conſider what a good Catholick may ſay to this point. And firſt I believe no man can reprove him if he ſay he finds no temporal power included in any Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recorded in Scripture, Tradition or the Fathers; and if he refuſe to believe more then he finds there, I think none will reprove him for that neither. In Scripture we find Saint <hi>Peter</hi> commiſſionated to teach, to baptize, to feed the Flock, to confirm his Brethren; we find the Keys of Heaven promis'd and given him, and what thoſe Keys ſignifie we find there declared to be this, that what he ſhould bind or looſe on Earth ſhould be bound or loos'd in Heaven. But of depoſing Kings, or diſpoſing of Kingdoms, we read no word. That his Commiſſion extends only to Spirituals, is a thing ſo notoriouſly known, and univerſally receiv'd amongſt Catholicks; none denying it but ſome Canoniſts who meddle <hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> and a few Divines who handle their <hi>crepida</hi> unskilfully and follow them, that to be ſerious and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the proof of it, is a labour as little needful and perhaps leſs pardonable then that which I have newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, of ſhewing Princes to be Vicars of God. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becauſe I am to ſay nothing of my ſelf, hear what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay.<note place="margin">De Anath. Vinc.</note> 
                        <hi>Gelaſias</hi> ſpeaks very clearly: <hi>Fuerant haec ante adventum Chriſti,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Before the coming of Chriſt, figuratively, and remaining yet in carnal actions, ſome were both Kings and Prieſts, as the H.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:33"/> to divine Worſhip, has imitated amongſt his Followers; ſo that amongſt Pagans the ſame men have been Emperours and chief Biſhops; but when we were once come to the true King and Biſhop (Chriſt) neither has the Emperour any longer aſſum'd the name of a Biſhop, nor the Biſhop the regal dignity. For although his Members, that is of a true King and Biſhop, are magnificently ſaid according to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his nature, to have aſſum'd both in a ſacred generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Regality and Prieſthood may ſubſiſt together; yet Chriſt mindful of the frailty of humane nature, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a glorious Diſpenſation what might conduce to the ſalvation of his People, has ſo diſtinguiſht the Offices of both Powers by proper Actions and diſtinct Dignities, deſirous his Followers ſhould be ſav'd by wholeſome Humility, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain betray'd by humane Pride, both that Christian Emperours ſhould need Biſhops for eternal life, and Biſhops in the conduct of the temporal things ſhould uſe the Imperial Laws, that the ſpiritual action might be diſtant from carnal aſſaults, and he who</hi> militat Deo <hi>is a Souldier of Gods, ſhould not embroil himſelf with ſecular buſineſs; and on the other ſide, he who is entangled in ſecular buſineſs ſhould not preſide over divine matters; both that the modeſty of both degrees might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, leſt he who had both ſhould be puffed up, and a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient profeſſion be particularly fitted to the qualities of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> This man was a Vicar of Chriſt himſelf, and you ſee he is ſo far from thinking his Commiſſion extends to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, that he plainly teaches Chriſt diſtinguiſht them, and left the ſpiritual Power ſo alone to him, that for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Laws he was to be beholding to the Emperour. I might peradventure have run the hazard of reproof, if I had ſaid that to joyn thoſe two Powers is an Artifice of the Devil, but I ſuppoſe that ſaying will not be reprov'd in ſo antient and ſo holy a Pope. <hi>Symmachus</hi> ſucceeded as to his Chair, being the next Pope but one after him, ſo to his Doctrine. <hi>You,</hi> ſays he to the Emperour, <hi>receive Baptiſm from the Biſhop, the Sacraments, Penance, deſire their Prayers, their Benediction; laſtly you adminiſter humane, he diſpenſes divine things to you.</hi> Greg. the 2d.

Theſe Popes underſtood and us'd their power as well as moſt of their Succeſſours, and they knew nothing of Temporal power, but confin'd what was given them to ſpiritual and divine things, and care of the Soul. And that this too is the ſenſe of the Church, I think will appear by the Prayer us'd on the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, which antiently ran thus; <hi>O God, who by giving the Keys of Heaven, haſt deliver'd to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>the Pontifical dignity of binding and looſing</hi> Souls.

Wherefore he left the Pope Vicar of that Kingdom which was given him by his Father while he liv'd on Earth; namely, the ſpiritual Kingdom over his Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Otherwiſe if he be the Vicar of Chriſt abſolutely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the power which Chriſt had, he ſhould have power over Angels and the Bleſſed, which is ridiculous.</hi> And again, <hi>Theſe powers are different from one another, and no man can uſurp either at his pleaſure; and to think and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is moſt ſeditious and moſt horrible.</hi> Anton. de Roſell. de Proteſtat.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:36"/> yet are good Catholicks for all that, and acknowledg'd to be ſo; neither are they otherwiſe reprov'd or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, then as Scholars take the freedom to cenſure one another. Mean time ſince a Catholick may unreprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold that the two powers were diſtinguiſht by Chriſt, and joyn'd by the Devil, the temporal committed to Princes, and the ſpiritual to Biſhops, who if they be Souldiers of God are not to meddle with ſecular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that while Biſhops diſpenſe divine, Princes are to adminiſter humane things; that to the Clergy belong onely ſpirituals, and the Popes power has nothing to do with poſſeſſions; that dominion is forbidden him, and onely the Rod of direction granted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope you may quiet your fears, and not ſuſpect I ſhall either be diſown'd or reprov'd by my Church, if upon the ſecurity of ſo much Authority I deny your firſt Propoſition, and affirm the Popes Vicarſhip is confin'd to ſpirituals, and that it hinders not Princes from being Gods Vicars as well as himſelf; who, if they manage all their truſt, are accountable onely to him, ſecond to whom they are, and except whom they have none above them, I mean in their own kind. Onely I would not have you boggle at this, that the Pope is not every where expreſly nam'd. For though the Order of Government require that the Head ſhould have more power then an inferior Member, as the Commiſſion of a General muſt be larger then that of a private Captain; yet I think none will doubt but the power of the Pope and the reſt of the Clergy is all of the ſame kind, and the more which belongs to him as Head of the Church, ſignifies more of the ſame ſort of actions, not power of another nature. But becauſe I am to ſay nothing of my ſelf, let St. <hi>Leo</hi> tell you this and more in a Sermon inſerted into the Churches Office on the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where ſpeaking of the Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the promiſe made him upon it: <hi>The force indeed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of this power paſt into the other Apoſtles, and the Conſtitution of this Decree</hi> (of the keys) <hi>deſcended to all the Princes of the Church; but 'tis
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:36"/> not without cauſe that what is intimated to all is commanded to one. For this is therefore particularly entruſted to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>becauſe the example of</hi> Peter <hi>is propos'd to all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church.</hi> And ſo much to the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which though I have abſtained from treating dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matially, yet I have ſaid, or rather ſhew'd you that others ſay what may abundantly quiet your fears, and that a Catholick who confines the Popes power onely to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, is ſo far from contradicting my principle receiv'd amongſt Catholicks, that he has the warrant of great, I had almoſt ſaid all Authority on this ſide, at leaſt ſo much that is not well conſiſtent with Catholick principles to oppoſe it. But I pray miſtake me not, for though I have ſaid nothing of my ſelf, yet I would not be miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted ſo much as to have alledg'd ought which might be thought to queſtion any, not onely ſpiritual, but even temporal power which may juſtly belong to the Church, and which when it does, ſhe may without doubt juſtly uſe. But 'tis one thing to have power by agreement of men, and another by Commiſſion from Chriſt, and I would ſay no more then St. <hi>Bernard</hi> has ſaid before me, that however ſuch things may belong to the Church, yet not by right of Apoſtleſhip. Your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſum'd that a Vicar had the ſame power with him whoſe Vicar he is; what I have alledg'd was only to anſwer that, and as I am not oblig'd, ſo I meant not to go farther.</p>
                     <p>What I ſhall adde in examination of your ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition you will perceive is more to ſatisfie your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then your Argument; for whether Chriſt had tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dominion or no, if he gave it not to the Pope, the Pope is never the near, and your Argument ſufficiently cleer'd. Notwithſtanding ſince I would not give you cauſe to complain I neglect any thing you propos'd, let us conſider how far this is true, that Chriſt had all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral as well as ſpiritual power. But, Friend, I hope your feud to formalities is abated, for I muſt tell you beforehand, there is no diſcourſing on this ſubject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinguiſhing the <hi>God</hi> from the <hi>Man.</hi> Yow know in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:37"/> Chriſt the diſtinct properties of both Natures were ſo united, that they both made but one Sacred Perſon, to which perſon nothing can be deny'd which can with truth be affirm'd of God, and none I think will be ſo madly blaſphemous to queſtion the abſolute Soveraignty and Omnipotent power of God over all things. But the ſame perſon was man too, and 'tis from that formality the Pope claims; for ſuppoſe 'tis no leſs impiety to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that what belongs to the Divine Nature is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any to whom that Nature is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, then 'tis to deny of the Divine Nature that which truly belongs to it. And this <hi>Bellarmin</hi> well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when he argues thus:<note place="margin">De Rom. Pont. l. <hi>5.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt as man while he liv'd on Earth neither had nor would have Dominion meerly temporal over any Province or Town: But the Pope is the Vicar of Chriſt, and repreſents Chriſt to us as he was while he liv'd amongſt men; Wherefore the Pope as Chriſt's Vicar, and conſequently as Pope, has not Dominion meerly temporal over any Province or Town.</hi> Speaking now of Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely as Man, thoſe who attribute temporal power to him, and make him a ſecular King, go one of theſe two ways. They either alledge right of Succeſſion by deſcent from <hi>David,</hi> or a particular grant from God the Father, in whoſe power it being to diſpoſe of all Kingdoms, they affirm he has transfer'd this Right upon his Son as Man. Of theſe two the firſt is hard to prove, and in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignifies nothing when 'tis prov'd. The deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Chriſt from, and that by two ſeveral beanches is recorded in the Goſpel; but deſcent gives a tittle to none but the neareſt of the deſcent, and that Chriſt was the neareſt, is ſo far from appearing, that I know not how it poſſibly ſhould. 'Tis true, that <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Poſterity Reigned to <hi>Jeconias,</hi> but of him the Prophet, <hi>Hier.</hi> 22.30. Foretold there ſhould not be of his ſeed a man who ſhould ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and have power longer in <hi>Juda:</hi> So that the Succeſſion of that Regal Line of <hi>David</hi> ſeems ended in him. 'Tis true <hi>Zedechias</hi> or <hi>Mathanias</hi> Reigned 11 years after him, who was not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:37"/> of his ſeed, for he was his Uncle; but from him to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristobulus</hi> of the Race of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> who firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſum'd the Regal Diadem, there was not any King at all amongſt the Jews. That <hi>Nathan</hi> or any of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity either Reign'd or had right to Reign nothing appears, and much leſs that Chriſt was the neareſt of the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents from either that or the other branch. In ſo much darkneſs I think 'tis evident there can be no clear title. However I conceive another thing is clear, which, even ſuppoſing that Chriſt were next in deſcent to <hi>David,</hi> would quite take away all Title to his Kingdom, and that is, that in his time the Kindom was legally and juſtly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from the Family of <hi>David,</hi> to the <hi>Aſmoneans.</hi> For certainly to affirm that the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and their Succeſſors, who with excellent vertue recover'd the loſt Scepter, and ſetled it in their own Family, were all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders and Uſurpers and Tyrants, would be a wild and prepoſterous aſſertion, and ſuch an one as would unſettle all the tranſlations of Empires which concur in the courſe of Hiſtory, whereof few perhaps have been made with greater virtue or more juſtice. What King can be ſecure of his Title if the <hi>Aſmoneans</hi> were no Rightful King? And if they were, deſcent from <hi>David</hi> gives Chriſt no more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> then Signior <hi>Paleologo</hi> (far be all irreverence from the compariſon) has to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Goodman Plantagenet</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> A title therefore by deſcent ſeems very hard to prove, but though it were prov'd, I think there is ſo little got by the bargain, that it might have been e'en as well let alone. For right to the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> is but right to the Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> and I ſuppoſe the Pope will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to have his Authority confin'd to the <hi>Guetto</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and be put to the trouble of Aſſembling the diſpers'd <hi>Jews,</hi> that he may have <hi>over whom</hi> to Reign, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ancient Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> from the preſent Poſſeſſors, that he may have <hi>where</hi> to Reign. He knows well enough the ſtrength and ſtability of long poſſeſſion, and I dare ſay will not change his ſpiritual title at <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:38"/> for the beſt and faireſt temporal title which can be made him to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and where elſe the right of <hi>David</hi> can give him any intereſt, 'tis hard to imagine.</p>
                     <p>The other Plea is a Grant from his Father, who may undoubtedly diſpoſe of Kingdoms, and every thing elſe as he pleaſes. But his uſual way of giving Kingdoms is to put thoſe to whom he gives them into actual poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Election, Succeſſion, the Sword or other ſecondary means. To give bare titles without other fruit is a courſe not ſuitable to the method of his proceeding. Lawyers indeed have invented a diſtinction betwixt the Dominion and <hi>uſus fructus</hi> of a thing, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is uſeful here below, but I ſuſpect diſtinctions are ſtrangers in Heaven, and that plain dealing providence deals little in <hi>Chican.</hi> However it be, being reſolv'd not to penerrate into the depth of the queſtion my ſelf, I ſhall onely obſerve to you what people ſay on both ſides, and leave you to judge. This ſhort reflexion by the way I ſuppoſe I may irreprovably make, that if the Father made any ſuch grant, the Son was not ignorant of it. And if he knew ſuch power was given him, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to uſe it, I perceive not how he will be excus'd from the blame of not doing what belong'd to him to do. A King certainly is as much oblig'd to govern, as a Subject to obey: and ſince 'tis manifeſt blaſphemy to ſay Chriſt was deficient in any point of duty, this in reference to my dulneſs is unavoidable, Chriſt did not perform the duty of a temporal King, therefore he was no temporal King. But theſe are onely my thoughts by the by, what people ſay on both ſides is this. Thoſe who would have Chriſt a temporal King, alledge in proof theſe places of Scripture which ſpeak of his power in general, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly apply the name of King to him in particular. Such as Heb. 1.2. <hi>Whom he made Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds,</hi> Heb. 2.7. <hi>Thou haſt Crowned him with honour and glory, and ſet him over all the works of thy hands. For in that he ſubjected all things, he left nothing not ſubject to him,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.24. <hi>When he ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:38"/> have evacuated all Principality and Power and Vertue,</hi> Mat. 28.18. <hi>All power is given me in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Jo. 23.3. <hi>Knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,</hi> Jo. 5.22. <hi>For the Father judges no man, but has given all judgment to the Son; he has given him power to judge, becauſe he is the ſon of man,</hi> Apoc. 17.14. <hi>They ſhall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall overcome them, becauſe he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> And again 19.16. <hi>And he has written in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and on his high, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</hi> Iſa. 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> Pſal. 2.6. <hi>I am made by him a King over</hi> Sion <hi>his holy hill, and a great many more of the ſame nature.</hi> Theſe ſay they and the like places, are both plain in themſelves, and plainly expounded of a temporal regal power by the Fathers. To which purpoſe they bring <hi>Theophylact</hi> expounding that to the Heb. <hi>whom he made Heir of all things; that is, made Lord of the whole World; but how did he make him Lord? Namely as man, in the ſecond Pſalm he ſpeaks to him, Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> And St. Anſelm <hi>upon the ſame place; Whom the Father appointed according to the humanity the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Heir of all things; that is, poſſeſſor of all creatures.</hi> And Haymo <hi>upon the ſame place too; God the Father apointed his Son Heir of all things, that is of the whole World or all creatures, not onely according to the Divinity in which he is coeternal to his Father, and coequal in the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence of the Deity, and in which he eternally poſſeſſes all things with his Father; but rather according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity aſſum'd by the word he is appointed Lord and Heir over all creatures, as God the Father promis'd him ſaying,</hi> Ask of me, &amp;c. <hi>And the Son himſelf riſing from the dead ſpeaks thus in the perſon of the humanity; All power is given me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> Euſebius Emiſſenus; <hi>He who according to his Divinity had alwayes with the Father and Holy Ghoſt power over all things; now alſo according to his humanity has receiv'd power over all things as Man. He who lately ſuffer'd let him Rule both in Heaven and in Earth,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:39"/> and be believed the God and Lord, not of the Jews onely but of all Nations.</hi>

Permit the Son to enjoy what was granted, permit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perform what he promiſed. Why do you ſet bounds, and fix Limits, when the whole Earth was promiſed by the Father? There is not any thing in any part of the Earth which ſeems exempt from his Poſſeſſion. The whole Earth with its Nations were given him.</hi> Theſe and the the like places are the chief ſupports of the affirmative o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; for I omit their Reaſons, not onely becauſe a man who were ſtrongly bent upon it, may invent ſpecious pretexts almoſt for any thing, and they ſeem to me no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but becauſe I take queſtions of Faith not properly to belong to the deciſion of meer Reaſon. I mean in this manner, that People ſhould raſhly determine by their ill grounded reaſonings, what is fitting or not fitting for God to do. We are to learn of our Fathers and the Church what he has done, and not by Airy ſpeculations determine what he ſhould do. If this Doctrine hath been delivered to our Fore-Fathers, we ſhall ſure enough receive it from them; but if we do not, it will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Faith, even though it could be proved true. In the mean time, thoſe who maintain the negative, bring particular Anſwers to all theſe places, the ſubſtance whereof devolves to this, that the Kingdom and Regal power attributed to Chriſt in the Scripture, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his Spiritual Kingdom the Church, unleſs where his perſon is ſpoken of as comprehending the divine as well as humane nature, in which Caſes, Regal power, and all that can be attributed to God, may juſtly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of him. 'Twere to write a Book inſtead of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dilate them all particularly, and when all is done, this is the ſubſtance: But then on their ſide they alleadge Scripture and Fathers, in my opinion much more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. And firſt they affirm the queſtion is expreſly and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:39"/> plainly decided by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. When being askt by <hi>Pilate</hi> if he were a King, he denies it not, but withal affirms his Kingdom is not of this World: And methinks people might take his word, and ceaſe to diſpute of what he ſo plainly determined, for I cannot think otherwiſe but this Anſwer meets the difficulty in the Face, and ſo reſerves whether the right of omnipotence or ſpiritaal Regality, as very poſitively to exclude Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power. They alledge again Luke 12.14. <hi>Who has made me Judge or Divider betwixt you?</hi> Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was moved by one who heard him, and perhaps believed in him, to cauſe one Brother to divide an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance with the other. And he not onely refuſes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſays in a phraſe uſual in Scripture of denying by interrogation, it was a matter in which he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do. Now if Chriſt were truly a Temporal King, 'tis hard to imagine how rendring Juſtice to his Subjects, who demanded it at his hands, and determining emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Controverſies, in which the very Office of a King does in a great meaſure conſiſt, ſhould not belong to him. I hove nothing to do with Poſſeſſions, and I am no Temporal King, to ſeem equivalent. They alleadge beſides, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.15. where Chriſt perceiving the multitude were reſolved to make him King, fled from them and hid himſelf. Put him to have received temporal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all the World from his Father, and 'twill be hard to unriddle why he uſed it not in this occaſion. His Subjects more diſpoſed to obey him, they were willing, they were forward to do their parts; what can be ſaid why he did not do his, and govern them? I ſaid before, and I cannot but repear it, 'Tis as much the duty of a King to govern, as of Subjects to be governed; and I cannot for my life imagine any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, why he ſhould refuſe to govern, then this, that he was no temporal King. If it may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to ſpeak freely, this poſition of temporal regal Power in Chriſt ſeems to me to include both nonſenſe and blaſphemy. For Nonſenſe it is to put a Power in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:40"/> him to no purpoſe, an uſeleſs Metaphyſical <hi>potentia</hi> never reduced into Act; and blaſphemy it is to ſay he was deficient in his duty: and how that poſition will get clear of either of theſe abſurdities, I can by no means underſtand. Other places of Scripture they bring, but theſe are the moſt material. Now becauſe a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick cannot be a Catholick, who maintains a poſition directly contrary to Scripture, for neither he nor his poſition would be endured, thoſe of the other ſide have invented ſeveral Senſes which they give to the places alledged; and though thoſe Senſes ſeem to me full of Nonſenſe, yet I cannot but commend in the Authors that they chuſe rather to contradict common Senſe then Scripture. But do you Judge; <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World,</hi> that is, ſay they, <hi>'tis not by way of Election or Succeſſion, nor governed as World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdomes are by Treaſuries, and Officers, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> To omit that a Kingdom of this World, though received and governed another way then uſually Kingdomes are, is ſtill a Kingdome of this World, for the World is the World let it be governed how 'twil; this ſeems to me to ſay that the Kingdom of Chriſt is no Temporal Kingdom. For tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdoms can not ſubſiſt nor go on without ſuch things; and he that ſays his Kingdom had them not, ſays plainly his Kingdom was ſuch a Kingdom which needed none of thoſe things. Which in other words I think is to ſay it was not a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Again,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt is therefore ſaid not to be of this world, becauſe at that time moſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdomes were got by injuſtice, and governed by wicked and idolatrous Laws, and ſuch the Kingdom of Christ was not.</hi> But pray, the Kingdomes now a days eſtabliſht with Juſtice and governed with equity, are they not Kingdomes of this World? Or did <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> forfeit his worldly Empire, by aboliſhing thoſe Idolatrous Laws, and making better in their places? Strange Interpretors of Scripture! Who would make worldly Kingdoms inconſiſtent with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:40"/> and Kings ceaſe to be Kings when they turn good men and moſt deſerve to be ſo. Beſides, if the world were divided into Kingdomes, however unjuſtly got and wickedly governed, t'was yet divided into King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and what Room was then left for Chriſt? Would they have him a King, and give him no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or a Kingdom no where? Farther what can be ſaid why he did not eſtabliſh his juſt Kingdom in the place of thoſe wicked ones, and take ſo much injuſtice out of the World? I think nothing but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that his Kingdom was of another nature, made to take away injuſtice from all, Dominion from none. I ſay nothing of the impertinence of alledging injuſtice in the beginning of Empires, a poſition which would ſhake the Foundations of the moſt ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and leave few Princes ſecure of their Titles. A third anſwer is, that his Kingdom is not of this World, becauſe <hi>not onely of this World, but of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth and all Creatures,</hi> as if this World and more were not this World. Beſides it miſtakes the queſtion too, which is not of the extent of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to which every Body knows that every thing is ſubject, but of the manner, whether beſides the omnipotence of his divine nature, and the ſpiritual Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his humane, there were in him a Temporal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and he were appointed by his Father as <hi>Saul</hi> to judge the People, and go before them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 21.8.</note> and fight their battles. This is what the Scripture tells us People expect from their Kings, and who ſpeaks not to this ſpeaks not to the queſtion. Farther they ſay that Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world, becauſe <hi>worldly Kingdomes are over Bodies, his over Souls; worldly Kingdomes require obedience to a Temporal Prince, his knowledge of, and obedience to the Prince of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: worldly Kingdomes are extinguiſht by death, or War</hi> &amp;c. <hi>his is perpetual and immortal,</hi> &amp;c. And this is to ſay as plain as can be ſaid, that 'tis ſpiritual and not temporal. For Temporal Kingdoms are over Bodies,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:41"/> and if Chriſts Kingdom be only over Souls, 'tis not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; again 'tis not temporal if it can not be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, for no temporal thing is immortal. Farther to contra-diſtinguiſh the temporal Prince from the Prince of Heaven is directly to yield the queſtion and change ſides. That prejudice ſhould be ſo ſtrange a blindneſs, and men think to anſwer by ſaying the very ſame with their Adverſaries! To that of the diviſion of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, they anſwer that <hi>what Chriſt refus'd was to be made Arbitrator betwixt the two Brethren.</hi> But beſides that, to underſtand the place of Arbitration ſeems a little violent; for Arbitration requires the Conſent of both Parties, and there appears nothing but the complaint of one againſt the injuſtice of the other. His anſwer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that medling with Inheritances was a thing with which he had nothing to do, and that, whether he thought fit or no to become an Arbitrator, temporal Matters belonged not to him. Again they ſay, his ſignify'd <hi>he was no Ordinary Judge, whoſe Duty and Obligation it was to determine civil Controverſies, but that his Jurisdiction was Voluntary and Arbitrary:</hi> And if this be not to ſay he was not a temporal King I underſtand nothing; for a temporal King, is oblig'd by his Office to do Juſtice and determine civil Controverſies, and his power is not Voluntary and Arbitrary, but Coactive and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They anſwer, that <hi>Chriſt meant his judicial power was not by humane conceſſion;</hi> as if he could not have done the buſineſs as well by Authority from Heaven as from Earth, and had not been that way more empowered, and more oblig'd to perform his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That <hi>Chriſt came not into the World to judge temporal things, though he had full power ſo to do;</hi> which is juſt what the other ſide ſays, that he was not ſent, or empower'd by his Father for that purpoſe, though as God he might do what he pleas'd. What a pleaſant folly this unreſolvedneſs to maintain a thing is, which makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:41"/> bring for anſwer the very poſition they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, He is ſaid to <hi>have refus'd dividing the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe Diviſion is the work of the Devil.</hi> Diviſion of hearts indeed is ſo, but diviſion of poſſeſſions is a work of peace, and a neceſſary means to Union of hearts; 'tis a command from God, and a duty in Kings.</p>
                     <p>This is chiefly what is ſaid on both ſides; you will judge as you ſee cauſe. I for my part believe none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the truth then Chriſt himſelf, and I mean to take his word and believe his Kingdom is not of this World, and I care not who knows it. If I miſtake his meaning, and that the Kingdom which he ſays is not of this World, prove yet to be a worldly Kingdom, I ſhall at leaſt have the comfort to err in very good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and good Company you know is a thing I love ſufficiently.

God did then give him the Seat of</hi> David <hi>his Father, when he was by him made King over</hi> Sion <hi>his holy hill. And he ſeems more plainly to declare what Kingdom it is of which he ſpeaks, by this that he ſays, not in</hi> Sion, <hi>but over</hi> Sion. <hi>For peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was therefore ſaid above, that</hi> David <hi>Reign'd in</hi>

                     <p>Theſe in my Opinion (for I intend here to end, and think I have done pretty fair for a Letter) ſpeak much more to purpoſe then thoſe alledg'd on the other ſide, who talk of Chriſts power in general, and at moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humanity; but what kind of power he had they expreſs not; the extent of his power, which no body denies, they aſſert very plainly, but are ſilent as to the quality of it, which is the thing in queſtion: Whereas theſe poſitively declare it not to be carnal, and temporal, and earthly, but Spiritual and Divine. They tell us plainly beſides what his Kingdom is: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Faithful, his Church, and the plenitude of Saints now a gathering, and to be compleated in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection when he ſhall deliver his Kingdom to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For my ſelf, though I have enough declar'd my Opinion; yet I declare withal I mean not to tie you or any man to it. Neither do I believe thoſe who are of a contrary judgment will be convinc'd by what I have ſaid, neither did I go about to convince them. My buſineſs was to ſatisfie you, not to dogmatize. And I hope you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:43"/> will perceive your Argument ſo anſwer'd, that if thoſe unquiet Spirits of fear and diffidence continue ſtill to hant you, the blame is not to be imputed to me. Of two propoſitions which you aſſum'd to fix a power Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount in the Pope upon our Faith; I have ſhew'd a Catholick may ſafely deny either of both. 'Tis at his choice to take either way, and any one does his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. If he will deny a temporal Regality in Chriſt, the difficulty is cut up by the root, ſince a Vicar can not with any ſhadow of pretence challenge more then was in the Principal himſelf. If not willing to meddle with that queſtion, he will take the other way, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that whatever power Chrit had, he left only Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual to <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, the difficulty is as fully cleared. A Catholick, take my word, may unreprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold either or both, and that you may have better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt your fears then my word can give you, I have ſhewed you both maintain'd by thoſe whom Catholicks are not permitted to reprove. If all this be not enough to quiet your ſuſpicious, let me add, that if you conſider well, you will find that of all men the Principles of Catholciks can leaſt endure the contrary Doctrine. Ask of your Fore-fathers, walk in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Paths, avoid novelties and the like, are <hi>Maximes</hi> ſo known and univerſally receieved amongſt them, that who is known to contradict them, is known ſo far to ſwerve from the acknowledged grounds of Catholick Religion. Now when the authority of unqueſtionable antiquity is of the one ſide, and on the other, that of Authors both late and few, and of no extraordinary cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, a Catholick who knows what he does, can ſo little doubt which part to take, that I think he is not excuſable if he ſo much as doubt, or at leaſt not otherwiſe, then as zeal is excuſed by blindneſs. None have that veneration for antiquity, and Fathers, which Catholicks pretend, for they look upon them as the men who have begot them in the Goſpel; from whence they give them the name of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:44"/> Fathers, as the moſt conſiderable Pillars of the Church, as the principal Perſons on whoſe atteſtation the Rule of Faith and Stability of Religion depends. After the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books of Scripture written by Divine Inſpiration, to which no writing of Man can be equall'd, nor ſo much as compar'd, we Reverence in the next place the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers, which we think uſeful too, and the moſt uſeful of any to the underſtanding of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, of which we hold them the beſt Interpreters. We univerſally blame thoſe of other Communions for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the obſcurity of private interpretations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the clear light of Tradition. And all theſe things are known and acknowledg'd by every body: Wherefore ſince the great Lights of the Church St. <hi>Aguſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and St <hi>John Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the reſt ſhine clearly out, and with a joint conſent unanimouſly conſpire into the ſame Doctrine, none are ſo blamable as Catholicks if they oppoſe it. And ſuch men as <hi>Comitolus</hi> and <hi>Sermari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the like put into the contrary ballance weigh ſo little, that tis ſhameful even that they ſhould enter in. The truth is, the world goes otherwiſe then ſharp-ſighted men would think it ſhould or could; elſe tis not eaſie to conceive how it ſhould be poſſible there ſhould be found amongſt thoſe of our principles, who ſhould ſtand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Fathers. All that can be ſaid is that worldly policy ſometimes makes a little too bold with Chriſtian ſimplicity, and that prepoſterous zeal is very blind, and therefore a very dangerous Guide. And I ſhall take the liberty to tell you that underſtanding Catholicks, who conſider the way they take, ſee, if it were followed in other things, it would mine Catholick Religion; and that the men indeed, perhaps by the priviledge of well meaning ignorance are Catholicks, but the way is not a Catholick way. Thanks be to God there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who walk in it, and thoſe who do, I believe conſider not what they do. For ſure I am that knowingly to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:44"/> ſleight the Reverence due to Sacred Antiquity, and ſet up new Maſters in oppoſition to the Fathers of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Doctors of the Church, agrees very ill with a Catholiek Spirit. In fine, as men will be men, and God muſt make the World another thing then it is, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that all ſhould do as they ought, you will find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Catholicks ſome who hold the contrary Opinion, but none who hold this reprovable. And this I ſay the more confidently, becauſe I miſtake very much if it be reprovable even amongſt the Jeſuits themſelves; who yet are thought the greateſt Favourers of the Papal power. At leaſt I know they cannot reprove it, without reproving their own beſt and moſt famous Authors. Read <hi>Bellarmin. de Rom. Pontif.</hi> the fourth Chapter of the fifth Book, and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat.</hi> upon 27 <hi>Mat.</hi> and ſee if they do not both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly hold and ſtrongly prove the Doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo far that the latter ſays people would make Chriſt a temporal King whether he will or no, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt his expreſs declaration, and that before a Court of Juſtice. They are too long to be tranſcribed. But if you take the pains to read them, ſince that is ſafe enough from being reproved which there is no body to reprove; I hope your ſuſpicions will be at quiet. However I think it but ſeaſonable that I ſhould, and be permitted after ſo long a journey to reſt</p>

Yet let me tell you, I think you have no great reaſon to complain; for, if I miſtake not, you owe a good number of your Proſelites to this very cauſe, and believe, that of thoſe who come over to you, far the greateſt part have been wrought upon by this perſwaſion, That you are ill repreſented. When you truly are ſo, as I cannot deny but ſometimes you are, 'tis no hard matter for you to ſhew it to candid people, whom nature has ſo diſpoſed to favour perſons wrongfully tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, that this bad Idea, where of you complain, makes you at laſt ſufficient amends. There is ſuch a charm in injur'd Innocence, that I am very confident it brings you in more Converts than all your Arguments. If ſome be hardned, others are gain'd; and peradventure fair play were more for the Intereſt of both ſides. However it be, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I was my ſelf ſomething miſtaken in you, and not ſo well acquainted as I thought with your Religion, where things I perceive go otherwiſe than I apprehended. I thought there had been an Oraculous kind of luſtre in this power of the Popes, which had either dazled you into a blindneſs of not ſeeing ought againſt it, or aw'd you into a fear of ſaying what you ſaw, if you ſaw any thing, and for ought I perceive you are as cleer ſighted as other men, and ſpeak bold truths as freely.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:47"/> of one thing, my thoughts inſenſibly carry me to another. I begin to conceit this Tradition of yours which makes ſuch a noiſe, and paſſes for ſuch a bugbear, may prove leſs frightful than our apprehenſions make it. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether the Pope has not as much reaſon to be jealous of it as Proteſtants. For methinks, if that be made the Teſt of Doctrines, and nothing impos'd upon our belief but upon the warrant of the conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring atteſtation of all Ages; This depoſing power of the Popes, which from its inconſiſtency with Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment I ſo much abhorr'd, muſt needs be excluded from the Articles of belief, and Proteſtans eas'd of a great deal of pains in pulling down that which your own beloved Principle pulls down to their hands. For ought I know, it may do as good ſervice upon other occaſions; however I avow to you, I am more friends with it than ever I was, and think Proteſtants have no reaſon to look unkindly upon a Principle which takes their part ſo much in a queſtion of ſuch importance. I wiſh with all my heart it were lookt into more throughly, for I miſtake extreamly if it would not cut off a number of thoſe things of which we complain, and though peradventure it be no diſcretion to ſpeak ſo freely to you, reduce things to that paſs, that while you labour to bring us over to you, That very inſtrument which you uſe to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, may force you over to us. But rather than ſuch a thing ſhould happen, I preſume the Pope would diſown it, and after he has us'd it as long as it would ſerve his turn, turn enemy to It as ſoon as he finds It turn enemy to him. But to tell you truly, I am ſomething in a better humour for Tradition, becauſe you ſpeak of Scripture with that reverence which is fit, and which pleaſes me ſo much the more by how much the leſs I expected it from you. For you know how ill you hear (pardon the pedantry of the phraſe) for failing in the reſpect due to that ſacred pledge of the Divine Love, which the fear, or rather conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs how cleerly thoſe undimmable lights would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the abundance of tares you have ſown amongſt the wheat of the Goſpel, makes you ſhut up from the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:47"/> and exclude from the Teſt and Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. And after this, to profeſs they are divinely inſpir'd, and that no other writings can be compar'd to them, is a thing which pleaſes indeed, but ſurprizes me too. Do you forget, or have you a mind to condemn your ſelf? For the Spirit of God muſt certainly be Gods beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, and where that is to be had (as in books di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpir'd, the Divine Spirit muſt certai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

To tell you my thoughts freely, If you would give a little more to Scripture than you do, and we to Tradition, I think things might be better betwixt us. For you pretend to hate Novelties, as I am ſure we do; All our whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation being nothing elſe but the rejecting what you have introduc'd. Let us have but Gods Law pure as he gave it, and free from the mixture of erroneous additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or diminutions, and we have no more to deſire. And if I underſtand Tradition rightly, and that it ſignifie what <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> has long ſince delivered for the teſt of Sound doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> what has been held ever, and every where, and by all, methinks you ſhould like No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties no more than We: for novelty and this cannot conſiſt together, and there needs no farther confutation of novelty, but only to ſhew that 'tis a Novelty. Which if it be ſo, in the name of God how fell we out? We all know that Chriſt was our only Lawgiver, and that upon the obſervation of the Law he gave us, all our hopes of Salvation depend; that ſince him there has been no new Law-maker, and whoever teaches any doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what was taught by him is long ſince declar'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema by the Apoſtle: that profane Novelties are to be avoided, and thoſe who broach or abett them are in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> wicked men who tell us ſtories, but not as thy Law, O God: And while we both agree in this, how is it poſſible we ſhould diſagree in ought? and what magick is it which thus ſets up Altar againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and divides the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt? In the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:48"/> darkneſs of Barbariſm and Ignorance, things might more eaſily be obtruded upon us, but in an age ſhining with ſo much wit and learning, and ſo cleer ſighted in Antiquity, methinks it is no ſuch hard matter to find out at leaſt which is the Novelty, and then if <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſay true, we know without more ado which is the Truth. Seriouſly Friend, I am at a ſtrange loſs and cannot poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle this Myſtery. But my zeal tranſports me, and I have almoſt forgot what we were talking of. To return to your Letter: It is I muſt confeſs long enough, yet I wiſh it had been longer, and that you had inſiſted a little more upon ſome Points there. Particularly that of the Princes power, Whether it be <hi>immediately</hi> from God, or only <hi>mediately?</hi> 'Tis true, you ſay what thoſe who hold it <hi>mediate</hi> I conceive will have much ado to anſwer; but yet you ſay it ſhortly, and determine not the point. I confeſs it was not neceſſary you ſhould; mediate or immediate was enough for your deſign, but not for my curioſity. And becauſe I judge the point of importance enough to deſerve a little more pains, I beſeech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, and ſhew me a little more at large that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of immediate power is unreprovable amongſt you, if it be ſo. Another is the Spiritual power, which you ſay was only committed to the Pope; but what that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power is, you ſay not, and by that forgetfulneſs or reſervedneſs, or haſte of yours, leave me much at a loſs. This <hi>Spiritual</hi> power of yours, for ought I know, may do all that <hi>Temporal</hi> power can do; and then we are never the near, and Princes as unſafe as ever. If their work be taken out of their hands, and they peradventure out of their kingdoms by this which you call Spiritual power, you might ev'n as well have kept the Temporal power too for any kindneſs you have done us. For 'tis the Power of which we complain, and whether you call it temporal or ſpiritual, if it be a power to do miſchief, 'tis alike grievous to us. I am the more ſollicitous of this for <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s ſake, and the ſtrange deſcant he runs upon that plain ground <hi>Feed my ſheep;</hi> a place he handles almoſt as odly, as he that on the word <hi>Confirmavit,</hi> made this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106994:48"/> gloſs (i.e.) <hi>Abrogavit;</hi> This Feeding, as he orders mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, amounting to little leſs than Deſtroying. A Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſaies he, has to do with Wolves and Rams, and Sheep; and Princes, as he contrives it, are all Three. If they leave your Communion, or in his language, turn Hereticks, they are Wolves, and to prevent the miſchief they may do the flock, your Shepheard at <hi>Rome</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powr'd to drive them away by excommunication, and command the flock not to follow them, for ſheep you know naturally run after wolves; but yet I perceive no great neceſſity of excommunicating thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd communion before. Then if retaining your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, They govern wickedly and wrong the Church by unjuſt Laws or actions, they are Rams, and your Shepheard is again impowr'd to ſhut them up, and reduce them to the condition of Sheep: Weathers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he ſhould have ſaid, for Rams ſeem to be a kind of Sheep, and Depoſing is his way of Gelding. Laſtly, all Chriſtians being Sheep, and Princes amongſt the reſt, your Shepheard may command and force them to do their duty; and the duty of Kings being to defend the Church and puniſh Hereticks, if they fail in this, he may puniſh and force them by excommunication and other convenient means; which convenient means is to depoſe them, and turn the Commonwealth topſy turvy, and fill the Country with rapine and bloud, and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences as War, and the worſt of wars, the Civil uſeth to produce. And all this is to feed the ſheep ſtill. In truth Friend, a little more would incline me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too, that the Bible is of too keen an edge for every body to manage; but I am not for all that of your Churches mind, for methinks 'twere better to keep it ſhut from the learned, and leave it to the ſimple, who at worſt would but cut their own fingers, and not their Neighbours throats. A plain man would never have found out, that <hi>feeding</hi> ſhould ſignifie putting folks into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtarving. Fighting certainly is a new way of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſure Chriſt did not mean his Sheep ſhould be fed with knocks. But to leave <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to his ſpeculations,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:49"/> if this be what you underſtand by your Spiritual power, your Doctrine is inexcuſable. <hi>Carerius,</hi> or whoever flies higheſt can give the Pope no more than all, and I ſee not that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> goes leſs. For if the Pope can command, and force Princes to obedience, and take them away, and ſet up others by his Spiritual power, I underſtand not what all the Temporal power in the world can do more. Wherefore either ſhew me a real difference betwixt theſe two Powers, and ſuch an one as leaves them at peace one with another, and each quiet in his own ſphere, or confeſs your Church teaches Doctrine incompatible with the ſecurity of Princes and quiet of the world; and that all you can do for her credit, is to raiſe a miſt of words, which may ſerve to hide her ſhame a while, and ſteal your ſelf from the difficulty, but when it breaks up, every body ſees plain enough how things go.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is and ever will be the fate of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. While they are intent upon one thing, ſome caſual expreſſion which they heed not, occaſions a new difficulty, and that many times diverts, ſometimes loſes the former inquiry. You have now ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted new game by your reflections upon <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> which, though the Quarry peradventure be as good as that we had before us, yet is not the ſame; And as they require as much labour and diligence, twenty to one, we ſhall meet with freſh game in the purſuit of them, and tire our ſelves with variety of change and catch nothing. Permit me therefore to refer you for thoſe points to thoſe Writers of ours who have handled them profeſſedly and exactly. The Objections are ſo ordinary and ſo often anſwered that truly I expected them not from you, and doubt while you ſo much lay to heart what is ſaid againſt us, you conſider little what we reply, which methinks is not ſo agreeable to your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. Otherwiſe 'tis eaſie to meet with information of what we ſay to thoſe things. But for your fears the Pope will not ſuffer us to ſtand to <hi>Tradition,</hi> let me briefly aſſure you they are vain. The Church has ſtood almoſt ſeventeen ages by it, and we ſhall not leave it till we have a mind to leave the Church. Popes are not the men you take them to be. 'Tis true they are men, and that a mixture of worldly conſiderations ſhould not ſometimes enter into their counſels, cannot be expected: but for all that they are good men, and ſo good, that you will not often find Princes more vertuous. It is ſo far from entring into their thoughts to aſſume to themſelves things prejudicial to the Church, that on the contrary 'tis the good of the Church which has been pretended to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:50"/> gain admittance for theſe things which indeed are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, but which if they had not been thought otherwiſe had never gain'd admittance. And if you think He who owns himſelf <hi>Father of the Church</hi> will not rather caſt off theſe pleaſing flatteries, when he diſcerns them to be ſo, than hazard the good of the Church, allow him yet to underſtand Policy, and have wit enough to perceive that his well-being depends upon the well-being of the Church, and the conſtancy of his power, and greatneſs, and whatever you envy him for. Take away the Church, and He is no body. O Friend! could that cleer ſight of yours look upon things without the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of <hi>prejudice,</hi> and conſider the office without the <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be avoided faults of ſome perſons, you would peradventure wonder at the averſion you have to a thing, ſo beneficial to Mankind, that the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has left us few more ſignal teſtimonies of his conſtant care over us. At leaſt for my part, I cannot but find my ſelf obliged to a grateful acknowledgment of His love to the Church, as often as I conſider he has appointed one whoſe office and duty it is to take care of her good, and placed him in ſuch circumſtances that to the efficacy of vertue and a good Conſcience, Intereſt and the preſervation of his own Concerns, and thoſe great ones, and all the conſiderations which ſway with men, are added to make him execute this Office well. A Common <hi>Father</hi> of Chriſtendom obliged by Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and intereſt to procure the good of the whole, and diſabled by want of the Material Sword which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Princes from doing any great harm, (Power diſarm'd you know, cannot be much miſchievous) is ſo great a good, that if the wiſdom and goodneſs of God had not provided it for us, I am confident thoſe who love Chriſtianity would have wiſht, and perhaps, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly endeavour'd to have ſet it up themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe the Popes as bad men as you will, ſuppoſe them to deſign the deſtruction of the flock they have undertaken to feed, to be careleſs of the place they hold in this world, and the account they are to give in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106994:50"/> the next, ſuppoſe them wicked, ſenſleſs and mad, To make the Church abandon <hi>Tradition</hi> is a thing beyond all the plenitude of His power. Hopes of happineſs, and Fear of miſery; Love to poſterity, and the Force of Nature, and Inclinations of Mankind, are things too deeply imprinted to be ſubject to any Awes or violence. But I have no intention to meddle with Controverſie, wherefore pray take it well that I refer you for more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if you deſire it, to thoſe who do.</p>
                     <p>Then for the Reverence, which from the natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of my thoughts, you find in my unheeded expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning <hi>Scripture</hi> you wonder at it, and I more wonder at your wonder; Yours I ſay, who, if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not, uſe not to give your ſelf blindly up to the conduct of other mens Prejudices; but deſire firſt to ſee Reaſon, and then to follow it. In the name of God what have Catholics ever ſaid or done, that you ſhould fancy them to have leſs reſpect for Scripture than is due to it, or than other men have. We hear ill indeed as you ſay; but alas! 'tis becauſe other men ſpeak ill. Sure I am, 'tis we preſerv'd the Scriptures for fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and if we had not, you had not had them to have reproacht us withal. You receiv'd them from us, and 'tis by our Atteſtation you know there are Books of Divine Inſpiration, and which they are; otherwiſe I know not vvhere you would have had them, nor how have known them. If you think vve read them not, and take no care to underſtand them; examine vvell the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expoſitours, and ſee if the Proteſtants equal the Catholics either in Number or Learning. <hi>But we keep them ſeal'd up from the Vulgar; and this for fear thoſe cleer lights ſhould too plainly diſcover the bracks of our Doctrine.</hi> I know not how charitable you think that Comment, but I am ſure I find it very irrational. If they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us in <hi>Latin</hi> 'tis a wiſe piece of pollicy, a deep reach of ſubtle craft to keep people from reading them in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;</hi> as if you had not learning enough to urge them againſt us in Latin, or we to underſtand you unleſs you ſpoke Engliſh. But thus ſtands the Caſe, whoever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:51"/> underſtands Latin needs no permiſſion to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vvho does not may have it for asking, provided he be not of the number of the unlearned and unſtable, who deprave them to their own perdition. Such there were in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s daies, and vve have but too much cauſe to fear the number is greater now; and if you think that to hinder the Perdition of men be to vvant Reſpect for Scripture, you may think as your Charity and Judgment ſerves you; but I think vve ſhall endeavour to ſhew ours by procuring their Salvation. The truth is, vve do little more in that particular than the Law, I think ſtill in force, obliges you to do. Look into the Statute, <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and ſee vvith vvhat limitations the Reading of the Bible is permitted. If you obſerve them not; we indeed are more obedient to our Laws, than you to yours; but the Laws of both are much alike: for all this vvhile num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of you read the Scriptures, and ſhew your reſpect to them in contempt of the Law, vvhich is a fine kind of reſpect. <hi>But we refuſe them for the Judge of Controverſies, Conſcious,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that they would give ſentence againſt us.</hi> Methinks men vvho impute vvant of Charity to us, ſhould be a little more vvary in making ſuch Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of things. But I beſeech you, What do you mean by <hi>Judge of Controverſies?</hi> If no more but this, that vvhatſoever is contained in thoſe Sacred Books is Truth, and Truth divinely inſpir'd, and ſuch as ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by all vvith a ſubmiſſion ſo abſolute and entire, that no Authority on Earth is permitted to oppoſe or queſtion the leaſt title of it; and that, vvhen of any point in Controverſie, or not in Controverſie, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of Scripture appears, there is no more to do, but immediately leave off diſputing, and receive it vvith the reverence and ſubmiſſion due to Divine Oracles. If this be all you mean, as I think it is, What Catholic ever deny'd, or queſtion'd, or doubted of it? We hold him neither Catholic nor Chriſtian that does. And as little as you think our Vulgar people acquainted vvith the Scriptures, I believe you vvill find few, vvho knows not thus much of them. Whether all this makes the title
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:51"/> of <hi>Judge</hi> belong vvith propriety to Scripture, you may, if you pleaſe diſpute vvith our Controvertiſts. But for the ſubſtance of vvhat vve hold, if this vvhich I have expreſt be that vvhich you hold, Catholics hold the ſame, and as fully and as firmly. I conceive, vvhen you affirm, and we deny Scripture to be the Judge (peradventure it might have been more proper to have ſaid, <hi>Rule</hi>) of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, vve mean not the ſame thing. For ſince all the excellent Prerogatives belonging to that Book, hinder it not from being a Book; and a Book muſt be made up of Words, and Words, and vvhat is ſignified by the Words, are different things; vve think it may be permitted us, vvithout contempt of Scripture, to think that difference is found in the Words of Scripture, as well as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For certainly to forfeit our Reaſon is a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous kind of reſpect. Now as far as I am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith Controverſie, I conceive that when we deny it to be the Judge or Rule of Controverſie, we mean the Words abſtracting from the Sence; and when you affirm it is, you mean the Sence abſtracting from the Words: For methinks, you ſhould not hold your ſelves, or pretend to perſwade us, that material Sounds, or ſtroaks of the Air, or Lines drawn by a Pen, are that very Word of God to which ſo much Reſpect is due: eſpecially when after ſo long a courſe of time, vve have not the Original Words neither, at leaſt that vve know to be ſuch, vvhich the firſt Pen-men us'd; but Tranſlation upon Tranſlation, and ſuch variety of Copies, that there is no ſmall difficulty in the choice. Pray enquire, and ſatisfie your ſelf, vvhether this be not the truth of the buſineſs; for if it be, I ſee not that you give more to the Words than vve, and that vve give as much to the Sence as you. For nothing can be plainer than that this Poſition, <hi>The Sence is the Rule,</hi> is no contradiction to ours, <hi>The Words are not the Rule;</hi> vvhich two are ſo far from irreconcileable, that they have no oppoſition, and may, for ought appears in the Terms, be both true. The Terms in vvhich the Controverſie is ſtated, <hi>Scripture</hi> is, <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>not</hi> the Rule, are indeed contradictory;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:52"/> but what we mean by theſe Terms has no oppoſition. For you mean that the Truth contain'd in Scripture, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, to be indiſputably believ'd by all; ſo that no Authority, whatever it be, on Earth, whether Pope or Church, can pretend any way to be exempted from entire ſubmiſſion to it; and this no Catholic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. We mean the Words of Scripture, becauſe we ſee them daily wreſted to ſeveral Sences, are not alone able to give us certainty which the true Sence is. And this I conceive no Proteſtant bound to affirm. For you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Fathers in difficulties where you are unſatisfi'd, and by their Authority either find, or juſtifie the Sence in which you underſtand the Words. Wherefore 'tis very evident, that we deny not what you affirm, and you affirm not what we deny, and that our only contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in this Point, is the Contradiction of Words which we both ſo underſtand, that there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in what we mean by them. For you ſay, We muſt believe what Scripture ſaies; and we ſay ſo too, We ſay, we cannot ſufficiently know by the bare Words alone, what Scripture ſaies, and we muſt believe; and you, I think, ſay not the contrary. Rule then with you, ſignifies Rule of Belief; or that which is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; with us, the Means by which we muſt know what we are to believe. Which two are as different as may be, yet both being confounded in the ſame word <hi>Rule,</hi> make a ſhift with the aſſiſtance of the peeviſh animoſity, and ſtiff croſneſs of our unhappy times, to keep us ſtill at odds, and expoſe us to the reproach of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful to Scripture, for denying it to be the Judge or Rule of Controverſie, when all the while we agree to what you mean by <hi>Judge</hi> of Controverſie. <hi>Heu quantum eſt in rebus inane!</hi> In ſhort, give us the true Sence of Scripture, and if we ſubmit not to it, with all the ready Obedience due to it, you ſhall not need to condemn us: Our public Profeſſions, beſides the ſelf conviction of Conſcience, will condemn us to your hands: but if we refuſe, to accept for Gods Word, a wrong Sence of thoſe words in which 'tis expreſt, I think, we ſhew more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:52"/> to the Word by deſiring a true one, than thoſe who would impoſe a falſe one. For 'tis only the True ſence which is indeed Gods Word; and there is nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from reſpect to it, than to accept a Falſe one inſtead of it. Pray, when a Presbyterian Interprets Scripture to the deſtruction of Epiſcopacy, or an Arian to the overthrow of Chriſt's Deity, or a Socinian of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Are you diſreſpectful to Scripture for rejecting their Interpretations, or they for making them? This we take to be the Caſe betwixt you and us, and that you offer us wrong Sences of Scripture, and then blame us for want of Reſpect to Scripture for not accepting them. Whereof, whatever be the truth, which I will not meddle with, this is plain, that we do no more to you, than you to Sectaries; and therefore cannot be thought to have leſs reſpect for Scripture than your ſelves. I have read ſomewhere, and I cannot but think it true, that for all theſe ſcandalous imputations, there are none who ſhew that true reſpect to Scripture, which Catholics do. For beſides the Reverence we bear to the Sence, we have alſo an Authentic Copy of the words, to which we tye our ſelves, and cannot refuſe in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whereas others take the liberty to fly from one Copy, and one Language to another, as beſt ſerves their turn: which a body would think, were a proceeding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd more of a deſire to juſtifie themſelves, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to thoſe Sacred Oracles. The truth is, the Controverſie betwixt us concerning Scripture, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Word of God; in which we both agree; but of the Means to know it, and that plainly ſhews the true Word of God is ſubmitted to of all hands. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, vve need not much trouble our ſelves to find it out, or care what it ſaid, if vve did not acknowledge it obliged us to Belief. And ſince you will not, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, ſay, that a wrong Sence of the material vvords, is the true Word of God, or Divinely inſpir'd; all this hideous contempt, vvherewith vve are reproacht, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more, than that we will not vvilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our eye-ſight, but think the vvords both may,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:53"/> and are too often wreſted to vvrong meanings; that is, that the Material vvords are not vvhat they ſignifie: vvhich is juſt to ſay, A man muſt needs deſpiſe the Grape if he think the Buſh is not the Wine. 'Tis ſtrange an Objection of ſo little ſubſtance ſhould be, or ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately preſt, or ſo univerſally entertain'd. You too talk gravely for Company, and admoniſh us of refuſing a Judge, to vvhom vve muſt one day ſubmit our ſelves vvether vve vvill or no; as if true deſire to know his Sentence, and true ſubmiſſion to it vvhen vve do know it, vvere to refuſe it. I do not know vve refuſe any thing of Scripture, but your Interpretation, vvhere vve think you are in the vvrong; and I truſt you vvill not ſay, your Interpretation is the Judge, vvho at the laſt day ſhall ſit upon the quick and the dead. <hi>But the Spirit of God is Gods beſt Interpreter,</hi> ſay you, <hi>and ſince that is to be had in Books Divinely inſpir'd, we ſhould ſeek no farther.</hi> How prettily does this ſound? and yet, hovv little does it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie? To have the Spirit vvhich is in thoſe Holy Books can mean nothing, that I knovv, but to knovv and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the Truth contained there. And then conſider vvhat vvork your zeal makes of it. This Meaning is the thing about vvhich vve differ, you underſtand it one vvay, and vve another. That then, vvhich is to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted is the Meaning of Scripture; that vvhich you aſſign for Interpreter, is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the very Meaning. Is it poſſible you ſhould not ſee, that this is to make the Interpreter, and the thing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted all one? That it ſuppoſes the ſame thing, both underſtood, and not underſtood at once? Underſtood as Interpreter, not underſtood as Interpreted. Nay, that it makes one thing the ſame, and not the ſame vvith it ſelf. For to Interpret, is to declare another thing, and yet this, which to be Interpreted muſt be another, you make the Interpreter it ſelf. Pray perſiſt not vvith your fine Language to perſwade us, that is to be the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vvhich vvhen vve once have, there is nothing to be Interpreted: for vvhen vve once have the Meaning, vvhich you call to <hi>have the Spirit,</hi> there needs no more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:53"/> any to tell us what we know already. Again, make us not deſpair of an end of our differences, by aſſigning ſuch a method to end them, as ſuppoſes them firſt ended before it can be apply'd. For the meaning being once known, there is no difference for your Interpreter to end. Beſides, ſince while we differ, one of us has not the true meaning of Scripture, 'tis a ſtrange method to reconcile us, to refer us to what one of us has not, nor can have while we differ. I examine not with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety you ſpeak, though to be the Spirit, and to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by the Spirit, ſeem different enough. But this is plain, that ſince the Spirit in the Books is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Spirit interpreting muſt be out of the Books. And this our Controvertiſts will tell you is to be ſought for in the Church, to whom was promis'd the aſſiſtance of the ſame Spirit with which the Books were written. And to them I refer you, if you deſire to diſpute the Point farther, for I intend not to meddle with Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. For the reſt of what you ſay of the myſtery of our diſagreement, who both agree in what we would be at, both condemn novelties, and deſire the Doctrine taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, 'tis a thing I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I wonder at as much as you, and can as little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle. <hi>Inimicus homo hoc fecit,</hi> is all I can ſay to it, and think our beſt remedy is to fall heartily to our prayers, and ſollicit the powerfull goodneſs of God, to throw down at laſt that wall of diviſion, whoſe foundation we are ſo far from being able to overthrow, that we cannot find where 'tis laid, nor upon what ground ſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a building ſtands.</p>
                     <p>To come then at laſt to our purpoſe; I did I confeſs ſpeak but little of the firſt point, the Power of Princes immediately from God, and the little I ſaid I thought was more then needed, and muſt think ſo ſtill, it ſeeming to me a queſtion of ſo little importance either way, that what I ſhall add is only in obedience to your commands, which in my opinion might have imploy'd me in ſomething more uſefull. But ſince your curioſity will not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſatisfi'd, let me tell you there are in this matter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:54"/> ſeveral opinions of learned men, and all opinions only, and only of learned men, for the Church has not at all interpos'd, and I believe either the ſame or at leaſt as great variety is to be found amongſt you. Some hold that the Civil Power is given by God to the Community firſt, which afterwards chooſes the form of Government moſt pleaſing or moſt proper, and the perſons to manage it. So that they make it deriv'd from God immediately to the whole, and by their mediation to the Magiſtrates. There are who affirm as much of the Church, and ſay, that as God and Nature intend firſt and more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole then any part thereof, as ſight is given prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the man, and to the eye as the inſtrument by which the man exerciſes it, ſo Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is given principally and properly to the Church, to the Pope and Biſhops as inſtruments, and thoſe who are to execute it. Again, When a Prince is ſaid to have his Power immediately from God, ſome diſtinguiſh this word <hi>immediately,</hi> and granting that the Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Subjects is immediately from God, which they ſay none denies, they affirm that to have theſe, and theſe Subjects, for example, the King of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp;c. is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God, but by one of the four humane wayes by which Governments are introduc'd, Election. Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Gift or juſt Conqueſt. In which, ſay they, the caſe of the Pope and Secular Princes is different, for to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to his Succeſſors, all Chriſtians of whatever Nation or quality were immediately ſubjected by Chriſt, but for other Princes obedience to them when they are Princes, is immediately commanded by God, but where and over whom they ſhall be Princes, depends upon humane means. Others think this acuteneſs alters not the caſe, and ſay, that the Power of a Prince is one thing, and the Title which he has to this Power is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the Power is as immediately given Princes as to the Pope, and that the Title to it is by humane means in both. For he has no Power but by the means of humane Election, more the Princes by Election, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:54"/> or the reſt. And ſo they make the deſignation of the perſon to be by humane means, but the collation of Power immediately from God in both. And thus every one ſpeaks freely as his humour or learning ſerves, and I for my part ſee not that this freedom is prejudicial any way, for while we all agree we are to obey our Princes, and if we do not, we diſobey God, theſe ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I conceive, are not much material. One thing there is, and but one that I can perceive which is of moment, and which I hinted in my former Letter, and that is, that Poſition, which makes the Power of the Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the People, ſeems liable to this preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, that they ſeem not to part ſo wholly with it, but in ſome caſes they reſerve a right to re-aſſume it again, as when Princes prove tyrannical, when the line fails, and the like. And this is a miſchief of which great care is to be taken, for one cannot eaſily find a greater. For if the People retain any Power, they muſt retain Judgement when to uſe it, and if they be Judges, when 'tis lawfull to oppoſe the Prince, when not, there is a gap opened to all manner of Sedition and Rebellion, or rather there can be no ſuch thing as Sedition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the world, at leaſt of the People. For when they oppoſe the Prince, 'tis a plain caſe by doing ſo they judge he is to be oppoſed, and if they be the Judges, they are no longer Rebels, but exerciſe a Power due to them; then which nothing can be more peſtiferous, and deſtructive of Government, and ruinous of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages mankind receives by it. Of which people may think as they pleaſe, but I believe the private men are they who reap the greateſt benefit by it, and are more happy then Princes whom many croſly envy, and might peradventure more juſtly pity. For certainly to be ty'd to perpetual labour and care, and un-intermitted ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude for the benefit of others, is a condition not much to be envy'd; and he, who ſecure of his life and fortune by the pains of other men, has nothing to do, but freely to purſue that courſe to which his inclination or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage leads him, is in a condition much more deſirable.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:55"/> Wherefore not only Princes, and all honeſt men with them, but all who are not ſtark fools, ought ſeriouſly to joyn to the preventing a miſchief ſo ruinous. Now as it is obvious and eaſily foreſeen, ſo there are ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which men have provided againſt it. Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that when the People have once parted with their Power, and choſen to themſelves a Form of Government and Governours, they part with it for ever, and have no more to do but obey for the future, without any right of intermedling in any caſe with commanding; and this is pretty well, and renders the Government ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Governours ſecure. Others think that they make all ſafe, by excluding the People from a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being their own Judges, and reſerving that Prerogative to the common Father of Chriſtendom, who, they think, will take that care to which he is obliged for the good of his Children. But this is a little more, and in truth too much ſuſpicious, and does not take away the harm, but transfer the power of doing it into other hands. For the ſame Inconveniences may be fear'd from the Pope, as from the People; eſpecially where Princes are his enemies, as many profeſſedly are, and all may be, even thoſe of his own Communion: And comes ſo near that univerſal Temporal Monarchy which ſome have attributed to him, that I do not think, that any of his Adverſaries will adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t it, or that his Friends will know how to maintain it. At leaſt for my part I do not. Others, and I think the moſt, both in number and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, take away all interpoſing of the People farther than to deſign the perſon as in Elections, or however they concur, but make the Princes power flow immediately from God, and ſo make it Sacred, and exclude both Pope and People, and all, but God himſelf from medling with it. And becauſe, this is the thing of which you deſire I ſhould diſcourſe, to thoſe Authorities already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in my former Letter, I ſhall add as many more as I think may ſerve for your ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeem deciſive of the queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is no power but from God.</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:55"/> For certainly it cannot conſiſt with them, that Power ſhould be from the People, or any elſe, but him.

For the Power which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted is ordain'd by God; ſo that now Rebellion ought not to be lookt upon as against Man, but againſt God. Tho.

In fine he was ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he thought it better to have recourſe to the Inquiſition than to more Arguments, and ſo cauſed the Authours to be cited to <hi>Rome.</hi> But his Patrons deſerted him not, and the Inquiſition of <hi>Venice</hi> protected him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Doctrine remain'd not only unblemiſht, but countenanc'd by the Protection of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe Commonwealth. Permit me to conclude this Point with an Authority, which with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man may peradventure ſway more than all the reſt, It being a Declaration of Parliament, and that in Catholic times, That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is, and alwaies has been, free and ſubject <hi>immediately</hi> to God and no other, in all that concerns the Regality thereof. 16. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. Forreigners may talk as their fancy or Intereſt leads them, but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a true Engliſh man will not eaſily be induc'd, to ſwerve from a Doctrine delivered him ſo Authentically by his famous Anceſtours.</p>
                     <p>I hope by this time your Curioſity is at an end, I am ſure my patience is, for I am quite tired with talking ſo long of a matter, which ſeems to me to afford little more advantage than to know, which of thoſe Authors who treat this Subject, is the beſt Schollar, and talks moſt rationally. For as I ſaid before, the Church has no waies interpos'd in the buſineſs, and poſſibly it is a thing not very proper for her to meddle with. She has receiv'd from Chriſt, and delivers to us, That Obedience to our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:56"/> Princes is commanded by God, and to be performed, not only for Fear, but for Conſcience. And this being agreed by all, and acknowledged for unqueſtioned and unqueſtionable Truth; The reſt of the ſpeculations may ſerve for entertainment of thoſe who delight in them, and for the reſt ſeem of little concern, till people ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate themſelves into oppoſition to that ſo certain, and ſo certainly known Doctrine; and then they turn not only bad Schollars but bad men, if they ſee what they do, however dangerous and as ſuch are to be treated.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I cannot gueſs what uſe you would make of this Immediate Power of which you are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, unleſs perhaps, you think the ſecurity of Kings not ſufficiently provided for without it, and that they may otherwiſe be oblig'd to render an account of their actions, not only to God, but to thoſe by whoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they have receiv'd their Power, and ſo a principal and neceſſary Prerogative taken from them. But this is ſo poſitively and expreſly ſetled by unqueſtionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that 'tis very needleſs, and rather prejudicial, to have recourſe to a ground which ſome queſtion, when the thing it ſelf is ſo unanimouſly agreed that none que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions it. Witneſs S. <hi>Cyril Alex.</hi> in Joan. L. 12.

Lactantius</hi> de Juſtit. L. 5. C. 24. <hi>Let not bad Princes, and unjuſt Perſecutors, who ſcorn and ſcoff at the Name of God, think they ſhall ſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Puniſhment— for they ſhall be puniſht by the Judgment of God— He commands us patiently to expect that day of Divine Judgment, in which he will honour or puniſh every one according to his deſerts.

And as he ought not, whatever he do, be excommunicated by his own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:57"/> Biſhops; ſo by other Biſhops he cannot be judged, ſince he ought be ſubject to the principality of God alone, by whom alone he could be placed in his own principality.</hi> For my part I cannot agree to the denyal of the power of Excommunicating in Biſhops: and yet St. <hi>Austin</hi> is cited, Gloſſ. in 13. <hi>Math.</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the multitude is not to be Excommunicated, nor the Prince of the people.

I alwaies thought, that much good had come to the world by Chriſtian Religion, and the concerns of Mankind went on more ſweetly and more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but that it ſhould be guilty of ſo great a miſchief as to ſhake the foundations of Government, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and neceſſary to humane Nature is a ſcandal, which methinks, a Chriſtian ear ſhould not hear with patience. And <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> give him his due, as much a favourer of the Pope as he is; in this yet is more a friend to Truth, and tells us, <hi>De Rom. Pont.</hi> L. 1. c. 29. <hi>That the Goſpel deprives no man of his Right and Dominion, but gets him a new right to an eternal Kingdom: Nor have Kings leſs power in the New Teſtament, than they had in the old.</hi> And yet He, with his diſtinctions betwixt Fact and Right, Power direct and indirect; with one whereof he ſtill endeavours to ward all blows, makes as mad work, and reduces things to as much confuſion. I ſhall ſay nothing to them more than to entreat you to be Judge your ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether, in what I have alledged, there be any room for thoſe Inventions, and whether the Doctrine be not delivered too plainly to be put off with ſuch eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I come to your <hi>Second</hi> Point; and for the fear you have of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Argument, peradventure it were Anſwer enough to ſay, That S. <hi>Bernard</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:59"/> what was meant by the word <hi>Feed,</hi> as well at leaſt as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and he, notwithſtanding all the Cardinals acuteneſs, tells Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> L. 4. c. 3. that to <hi>Feed</hi> is to <hi>Evangelize. Perform,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>the work of an Evangeliſt, and you have fulfilled the duty of a Paſtour.</hi> Again, Serm. de Reſurrect. <hi>Feed with your Mind, with your Mouth, with your Actions; feed with prayer of the Mind, exhortation of the Word, propoſal of Example.</hi> I ſuppoſe no good Catholic, but will ſide with S. <hi>Bernard</hi> rather than <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> for as great a Schollar as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was, he is not yet thought a match for S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> But neither is he alone of this mind. <hi>Petrus Bleſenſis</hi> ſaies almoſt in the ſame words, Ep. 148. <hi>What is to Feed the Sheep, but to Evangelize, to render the People acceptable to God by Word, by Work, by Example.</hi> And thus <hi>Innocent</hi> III. and a great many more are cited by <hi>Caron,</hi> to interpret this word <hi>Feed;</hi> ſo that all the Cardinal's ſubtle ſpeculations upon the metaphor us'd in the Goſpel, hinder not the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from being as inſignificant as you, and more beſides you to my knowledge think it. And if I have not yet ſaid enough to it, hearken a little to S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> de Sacerd. L. 2. <hi>It is not lawful for a man, to cure a Man with the ſame Authority with which a Shepheard cures his Sheep. For here it is free to bind and reſtrain from paſture, and burn and cut; There the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and power of the cure is not in him who Adminiſters, but in him who is Sick.</hi> But we ſhall hear more of him anon.</p>
                     <p>Mean time, ſince the Point you have propos'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your recommendation, deſerves in it ſelf more conſideration than this Argument. Let me tell you for your ſatisfaction, That thoſe who treat theſe things put many differences betwixt the Spiritual and Civil power, from the manner of Inſtitution, the ends at which they aim, the means they uſe to their ſeveral ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That which I conceive moſt to your purpoſe, is either grounded upon, or warranted by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:59"/> Inſtruction left by S. <hi>Peter</hi> to his fellow Paſtours, in theſe words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>Feed the flock, of God which is among you, providing not by conſtraint, but willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, neither for filthy lucre ſake but voluntarily, neither as over-ruling the Clergy, but made Examples of the flock from the heart.</hi> From theſe words ſome gather this difference betwixt the Spiritual and Temporal Power, that the one is accompanied with the power of Conſtraint, the other not; I know the word <hi>Coacte</hi> is ſometimes expounded otherwiſe; and that ſome, and in particular <hi>V. Bede,</hi> underſtand by it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Mercenary intereſt, which in ſervice ſome propoſe to themſelves, while others ſerve for Love. And this ſence is without doubt a good and a true one; but I know not whether the Apoſtle meant it, though peradventure he, or rather his Inſpirer might, according to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Rule, That all the Truth was meant by God which is contained in the words he Inſpired. Otherwiſe, that ſeems to be the import of the Second Branch, <hi>Not for lucre but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily;</hi> and this Interpretation, with a needleſs <hi>tautology,</hi> makes the two branches ſignifie but one thing, which the Apoſtle ſeems nevertheleſs to diſtinguiſh. However it be, conſidering that before S. <hi>Peter</hi> Chriſt himſelf puts <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>non-dominion,</hi> for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Secular and Spiritual Power. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles have dominion over them— but you not ſo. Luke</hi> 22.25. And that S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, The arms of his warfare are not carnal. Cor.</hi> 10. I conceive that whatever S. <hi>Peter</hi> meant, this doctrine is very true, that Force and Conſtraint belong only to the Civil Magiſtrate, and not to the Spiritual: I mean in vertue of his being a Spiritual Magiſtrate; for theſe Formalities, of which you profeſs'd ſo much diſlike, return again in ſpight of my teeth, and there is no diſcourſing without them. Otherwiſe, the man who is a Spiritual Magiſtrate may upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts juſtly have, and juſtly uſe Conſtraint; nay,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:60"/> it may be his due in conſideration of his Spiritual Magiſtracy, but not originally deduc'd from thence, but annexed to it, or accrued by other means. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> mentioned in my laſt: <hi>Not by right of Apoſtleſhip.</hi> Now if I can make out to you, that it may irreprovably be held in our Church, that this Spiritual Power, of which you are ſo jealous, cannot uſe Force or Conſtraint upon any man, I hope you will have no cauſe of complaint againſt it, nor fewel for thoſe fears which ſtill diſquiet you. For certainly, a Power which cannot uſe Force is a little dangerous. If it can perſwade you to what it would, you then act by your Inclination or Choice; but if it cannot, you are free to do what you will: And I think, you would not wiſh to be more ſafe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then, what men they are whom they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, who will reprove this Doctrine. And firſt, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> delivers it very plainly, Epitaph. Nepot. Ep. 3. <hi>We muſt obey the Biſhop as the King, nay the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop leſs than the King, for he is over the unwilling, the Biſhop over the willing. One ſubjects by Fear, the other is given to Service; One impriſons the Body to death, the other preſerves the Soul to life.</hi> S. Greg. Nazian. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget. <hi>We ought not to conſtrain by Force or Neceſſity, but perſwade by Reaſon and Example of our lives.</hi> Again, <hi>Our Law and Law-maker have eſpecially provided, that the flock be fed not by constraint, but freely and willingly.</hi> And, Orat. 1. cont. Jul. Apoſt. <hi>Theſe things</hi> Julian <hi>had in his mind, as thoſe who were privy to his ſecrets diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but he was reſtrained by the clemency of God, and the tears of the Chriſtians, whereof many, and by many had, now been ſhed, ſince this was their only remedy against a Perſecutor.</hi> S. <hi>Jo. Chryſoſt.</hi> in Act. Hom. 3. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the care of a Biſhop with the care of a Father, makes that of a Biſhop much more heavy, as having more Children and leſs Power. <hi>What,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>will not the Biſhop endure who has ſo many not of his houſhold Family, but whoſe Obedience is in their own power.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:60"/> 
                        <hi>The Emperour has command over the whole world, the Biſhop is Biſhop only of one City, and yet he has as much more care as there is difference betwixt a River ſtir'd with the wind, and the Sea ſwelling and raging. Why ſo? becauſe there are there more helps, ſince all things are perform'd by Laws and Commands, here is no ſuch thing; for it is not lawful to command by Authority.</hi> Hom. 10. in 1. Theſſalon. <hi>A Father both by Natural and Civil Laws, uſes his Child with much freedome. If he inſtruct him againſt his will, if he ſtrike him none hinders him, nor dares the Son himſelf look up. A Prieſt has much difficulty: for firſt he muſt rule thoſe that are willing to be ruled, and whom by his government he is to pleaſe. Again, We domineer not over your Faith, Beloved, nor order theſe things by the right of command and dominion. To us is commended the ſpeech of Doctrine, not the Authority of Power and Principality. We hold the place of Counſellors and Exhortors: He who counſels when he delivers his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, forces not the hearer to accept it, but leaves in his power the free choice of what is to be done.</hi> And Hom. 1. in Ep. ad Tit. <hi>I omit to ſay that a Biſhop cannot with truth be called a Prince. Why? Becauſe it is in the Power of their Subjects to obey, or not.</hi> Again, De Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot. L. 2. <hi>External Judges when they find wicked men who have tranſgrest the Laws, ſhew themſelves endued with great Power and Authority, and force them to change their manners whether they will or no. But here we muſt not uſe force but only perſwade, and by that means make him become better whoſe cure we have undertaken. For neither have we any Power given by Law to force Delinquents, and if we had, we have not whereon to exerciſe this force and Power, ſince Chriſt gives an eternal Kingdom to thoſe, who not by force but by a firm reſolution of the ſoul abſtain from ſin. Wherefore there is need of much art, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who are ill-affected will perſwade themſelves that they ought ſubmit to the cure of Prieſts.</hi> Again, upon theſe words in the laſt to the Heb. Hom. Ult. <hi>Obey your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> that they may do this with joy, not lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                        <hi>&amp;c. You ſee that when an</hi> Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Prince is contemned, he ought not return revenge, but all his revenge is to weep and ſigh.</hi> And upon Iſa. 6.

C. 2. ſays, <hi>The material ſword uſed in the Old Teſtament by</hi> Moyſes <hi>and</hi> Phinees, <hi>was a figure of the degradations and excommunications to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the New, when in the diſcipline of the Church, the viſible ſword ſhould ceaſe.</hi> Origen Tract. 12. in Mat. <hi>Jeſus taking occaſion from the two Brothers, who ſought to be advanc'd above the other Apoſtles with indignation of the rest, ſettles the Rule of justice to the faithfull, how a man may obtain the firſt place with God. The Princes of the Gentiles not content only to Rule their Subjects, ſeek vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to Command them. But with you who are mine, this ſhall not be. Leaſt they perhaps who ſeem to have Principality in the Church, ſhould domineer over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or exerciſe power upon them. For as all Carnal things are by neceſſity not willingneſs, and Spiritual by willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not neceſſity; ſo the principality of Spiritual Princes ought to be placed in the Love, not Corporal fear of their Subjects.</hi> And after he had ſpoken much of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility befitting Prelates, leaſt he ſhould be thought an enemy to their true Power, he ſo Anſwers that Objection that withal he explicates wherein that Power conſiſts, Adding, <hi>This I ſay not to debaſe the Eccleſiaſtical Principality. For it is ſometimes fit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtolical Instruction, publickly to rebuke ſinners that the reſt may be afraid. It is ſometimes fit he ſhould uſe his Power</hi> (What is that?) <hi>and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sinner over to Satan to the destruction of the fleſh, that his ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

Extrav. de Judiciis</hi> teaches us, that if a Clergy-man remain after Depoſition and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſtill incorrigible, <hi>ſince the Church has not Power to do more, he is to be restrained by the Secular Power, and baniſhment or ſome other lawfull puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi> And this ſeems to me very evident from the Cuſtom of the Church even at this day, when if a Clergy-man be found guilty of a crime which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves death, they deliver him degraded over to the Secular Magiſtrate to receive him. I know that ſome would have this to proceed only from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the Canons, which for decency forbid the Clergy to meddle with bloud. But by their favour, conſidering the unanimous Doctrine of the Fathers before delivered, I cannot think but the true indecency is the want of power, or in St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s language, their thruſting their Sickle into other mens Harveſt. Otherwiſe an action truely vertuous ſeems far from indecent, and to purge the Commonwealth of a bad Member is not only a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but a neceſſary one too, and ſuch as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth cannot ſubſiſt without. Not only the Judge, but the Executioner too may be Saints for all the ſeverity of their Offices, and I ſhould think that things which conſiſt with vertue ought not be thought miſ-becoming, and what are neceſſary can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, So that I muſt needs believe this Cuſtom of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:63"/> the Church implies her ſence, that her Power is at an end when ſhe has us'd her ſpiritual rod, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; and if any more be fit to be done, ſhe muſt have recourſe to temporal Power, which if it think not fit to proceed, I know not why they are not at their liberty.</p>
                     <p>This is what occurs to me in Anſwer to the point you propos'd. I hope it will prove ſatisfactory, and fully quiet the jealouſie you have of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power. For certainly there cannot be a more unreaſonable fear in the world, then to fear that which you know can do you no harm. That men ſhould be in the world impowr'd to declare to us the commands of God, and way to Heaven, and preſs them by efficacious perſwaſion upon us, and take all opportunities in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon to that purpoſe, is ſo far from prejudicial to mankind, that we cannot fancy a greater nor more needed Good. And if you will take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, you muſt take mankind away too. For if our nature require we be govern'd by reaſon, it requires too that men be permitted to ſhew it us when we ſee it not of our ſelves. If perſwaſion and exhortation be thought harmfull to men, our nature is fram'd very ill upon which thoſe harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things are in proper means to work, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and all ſociety muſt end when theſe things are forbidden. For what uſe is there of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, if it become unlawfull for me to perſwade another man to his own or my good? If it were not folly to dilate a point ſo plain, what might not be ſaid of it? Farther, if men become obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and will not hear reaſon, it is very natural and very fit they ſhould be reclaim'd if it may be, by openly ſhewing them their fault, and making them ſenſible they are in the wrong, which if they be, 'tis fit they ſhould amend, if they be not, the company before whom the reprehenſion is made,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:63"/> will ſee it, and take their parts. And he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them wrongfully will incur the ſhame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them. So that by this Power none will run the hazard, ſo much as of ſhame, but thoſe whoſe obſtinacy in ſin truly deſerves it. Indeed, I have not known this Power put in practice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we owe the diſcontinuance of it to the Laws or Confeſſion; but 'tis plain 'tis in the Church, and good for Mankind, it ſhould be ſo. After this, if the Sinner remain yet obſtinate what remains, but that vertuous men and the Church ſhould have no more to do with him, who will not do good to himſelf, and may do harm to others; but look upon him, in our Saviours language, as an <hi>Ethnic</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> and have no Commerce and Communication with him, till Repentance reſtore him to his former condition? In which I take the ſubſtance of Excommunication to conſiſt. And this I conceive is ſo far from harm, that, I ſuppoſe, you will make no difficulty to allow it all; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours, but all who pretend to the title of a Church, claiming thus much Power at leaſt. For, that which you only do, and only can fear, that this Spiritual Power ſhould go too far, and look upon the diſpoſing of Kingdoms and altering Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, as things within her reach; I hope I have brought you ſufficient evidence to make you ſee, that the All fore-ſeeing Providence of our Wiſe Law-maker has provided abundantly for your ſecurity, in diſtinguiſhing the two Powers, and putting them into ſeveral hands; and committing the Spiritual Sword to the Church, the Material to the Prince. For if the Spiritual Power cannot uſe Force, and be only over the Willing, and ſuch as may chuſe whether they will obey or no; which you ſee the Fathers plainly affirm, there is no poſſible fear from it. If any encroachments be made to the prejudice of other mens Rights, we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:64"/> have the ſame ſecurity againſt them as againſt all Injuries, the Protection of our Prince oblig'd to defend us, and arm'd with Power to do it. We are taught, He bears not the Sword in vain. And we ſee by experience he does not. For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe flattering Poſitions, which you make ſo terrible, Princes know well enough how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves and their Subjects from receiving any harm from them. So Catholics have done in all times, and ſo they do ſtill. 'Tis true, they are generally willing enough to gratifie the Pope, with permitting any thing to be ſaid in his favour; and ſhew that reſpect to the Common Father of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, as to let him, and thoſe who are addicted to him, ſay even what they pleaſe. But yet they do as they think fit: And make no difficulty to Aſſemble National Councels, and ſettle even Eccleſiaſtical Affairs with their own Biſhops; nay, to make War upon the Pope himſelf. And while they uſe the Sword, are juſtified ſtill by the Pens of Learned men who take their parts. For all this, they leave not off their reſpect to their Church, but ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Civil concerns, that they leave the Rights of the Church untoucht; and make Peace with ſo much reputation to the Pope, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not ſometimes to ask pardon, even when they are the perſons wrong'd. But while they give this reſpect to the Vicar of Chriſt, they leave not for all that to do their buſineſs, and preſerve their own Rights. And while they keep the Sword in their own hands, let the Pope talk as he pleaſes, think themſelves ſecure enough, They apprehend no great danger from <hi>Solligiſms,</hi> which they can uſe at any time, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſince it may be dangerous to a Prince, that the minds of his Subjects be poſſeſt with falſe Doctrines, eſpecially in matters concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which men generally prefer before Allegiance,

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not how it happens; but the more you ſhew me, methinks the leſs I ſee. While I read your Letters I find not what to except againſt; yet when I look off I remain ſtill unſatisfi'd. That there ſhould be a Spiritual Power diſtinct from the Temporal, is plainly neceſſary in it ſelf, and own'd by us. We go not to <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> for remiſſion of our ſins, or to hear the Word of God preach'd, or receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe things belong to Spiritual Magiſtrates, amongſt whom the Chief with us is the Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> as with you the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſince for Orders ſake, and the nature of Government, a Chief there muſt be, It matters not much whether, as one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſaid, the top link of the Spiritual Chain be faſtned to the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or of <hi>Rome.</hi> So the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Primacy be undiſturb'd, and undiſturbable by the Spiritual, it ſeems all one vvhether have it; I mean in point of Safety, for true or falſe is another queſtion. And truly, I neither ſee how your Spiritual Primacy ſhould diſturb it, if all be true you ſay, nor why I ſhould doubt of the truth of what you ſay, while I conſider you ſay nothing of your own head; but bring ſuch Vouchers for every thing, that I think your Church cannot ſay otherwiſe, unleſs ſhe throw off that Reverence which, with ſo much oſtentation, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to have for Antiquity. And yet of neceſſity there muſt be more in it. The miſchiefs, againſt which I would be ſecur'd, have actually happened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Princes have been depoſed, and the world has been too much concerned in the effects of this Power to be ignorant of it. Our own Princes have not been exempt from attempts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:67"/> and the hazard the nation ran in 88. is not yet out of our memory. So that manifeſtly, either you believe one thing and do another, or you have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me truly, but covered an ugly face with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom vizar. Truly I believe better of your candour, than to ſuſpect you deceive me by deſign; yet certainly things are not ſo cleer and ſmooth of your ſide, as you would make me believe. To read your Papers, one would think nothing could be more innocent than your doctrine in this Point; yet the vvorld is witneſs of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings far from Innocent. I muſt confeſs, I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſufficiently perplext to unriddle this myſtery. But at laſt I remembred <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and vvhen I reflected on his <hi>Indirect</hi> and <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia</hi> Power, methought I had found the clew to guide me out of this Labyrinth. That diſtinction does it Friend, and in truth, I never ſo well underſtood the vertue of Diſtinctions before; for by the help of this, I perceive you may ſay enough to paſs for honeſt men, and in the mean time reſerve as much liberty as heart can vviſh to play the knave. Pardon my bluntneſs, 'tis without malice I aſſure you; but I am too much intent upon the Queſtion to be choice of my vvords, eſpecially to you: and conſider a little. You have told me the Spiritual and Civil Power are diſtinct; that the Popes Power is Spiritual, and is not Coactive. Why <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and any that follows him, will grant all this. But, if vve conclude thence, That the Pope has nothing to do vvith Temporals, they vvill not ſuffer us, but ſay, His Power is indeed of its own nature Spiritual, and directly regards only the good of Souls, but if Temporals concern that good, His Power is extended to them too; not directly, as if they were its proper object: but indirectly, as they collaterally fall in, and are joyn'd to that which is its proper object. So that they intend not, that any part of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which I conceive prejudicial to Princes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Government, ſhould be taken from him, but plainly ſeek to eſtabliſh it, though another vvay; and whereas, Others go plainly to work and tell us,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:67"/> without more adoe, That the Pope is the only Supream Monarch of the Earth; Theſe go a little about the buſh, and ſay indeed, He is not directly Lord of Temporals, but come at laſt to the ſame, and tell us, He may as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably diſpoſe of them as if he were. If this be true, all you have ſaid is to no purpoſe, and all you can ſay, while you ſtick to this, will not abſolve you from inconſiſtency with Civil Government. For 'tis a plain caſe, If the Pope may interpoſe in the diſpoſition of Temporals as often as they have relation to Spirituals, that He may interpoſe alwaies: Since of neceſſity they muſt, and cannot but, be alwaies ordered either well, or ill; and both caſes belong to the concern of the Soul. And then 'tis all one, as ſome body in this caſe handſomly ſaid, whether my eyes be put out by a direct ſtroke of a Tennis Ball, or by Bricol. <hi>William Rufus</hi> was as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded by the Arrow which glanced, as if it had been ſhot directly at him. If Princes may lawfully be depos'd, and their Subjects abſolv'd from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and oblig'd to obey the commands of another; and that in Temporals, they are no longer Sovereign, nor abſolute even in Temporals; and whether the Power above them be Direct or Indirect, Spiritual or not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſo it be a Power and can act, they are alwaies unſafe. Pray Friend let me have no dodging. Tell me plainly, Is this the Doctrine of your Church, or is it not? If it be, unleſs you can ſhew me, That thoſe can be good Subjects, and true to their Prince who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge another Power, which they are to obey againſt their Prince; and how that Prince is Supream in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, who has another above him, whoſe Commands he is to obey in the diſpoſition of thoſe Temporals; or if he do not, his Subjects are not to obey him, I muſt, for all you have ſaid, continue in my firſt thoughts, and not believe you tolerable in any Commonwealth. If it be not true, I think you would deſerve very well of your Church, to free her from the ſcandal which the credit of thoſe who hold this, and the countenance ſhe gives them, brings upon her. In all events, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:68"/> you, ſpeak plainly, for elſe I muſt needs think, either that your Church teaches you to hold what you are aſham'd to own, or, vvhich is worſe, obliges you to conceal the Miſchief ſhe teaches, that by the reputation of a fair Outſide you may preſerve your ſelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to appear to purpoſe, vvhen time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity make it ſeaſonable for her to diſcover her injuſt deſigns. If this happen, I muſt needs profeſs I ſhall have a worſe opinion of your Church than ever I had. For to maintain a falſe or bad Doctrine, which you think to be true or good, is but Errour, a fault, which, unleſs other Circumſtances aggravate the caſe, is very pardonable, becauſe very natural. Men were not men, if they were not ſubject to it. But to teach Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and keep this wickedneſs conceal'd from thoſe who are not as wicked as themſelves; to pretend a ſound Outſide, and carry a rotten heart, has ſo much Malice joyn'd to the Errour, that 'tis abominable in a private man, and I have not a name abominable enough to ſay what 'tis in a Church. After all your brags of Sanctity, I hope you vvill not fall into the woe, which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel pronounces againſt <hi>Whited Sepulchres, beautiful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but within full of dead mens bones and filthineſs.</hi> In fine, if you think <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Doctrine true, you have the liberty to make it conſiſtent with Civil Government if you can. I'le promiſe you to conſider what you can alledge as fully and impartially as you can deſire, and give every Argument its full weight. But if you ſay nothing, or dodge it off, which is as good as ſaying nothing, being well enough acquainted with your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to know you are not backward to communicate any thing you can to the ſatisfaction of your Friends, eſpecially when it tends to the juſtification of your ſelves, I ſhall know how to ſet the ſaddle upon the right horſe, and without putting you to the confuſion of revealing the ſhame of your Mother, conclude you are forbidden to ſpeak; and, though you were not, allow you do wiſely to ſay nothing, where nothing is to be ſaid that can make for your juſtification. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106994:68"/> Jeſuite <hi>Fiſher</hi> was commanded by King <hi>James,</hi> to deliver his Sence of this amongſt other Points propos'd to him: And he Anſwered the reſt, but paſt this over with this plain Confeſſion for his excuſe, That he was forbidden to ſpeak of that Subject. If you follow his Example, I ſhall believe you have one Religion vvhich you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for your Reputation, and another vvhich you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal for your Intereſt. I ſhall expect your Anſwer vvith impatience, and in the mean time remain</p>

                     <p>I Muſt confeſs I ſhould have thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to you, if you had diſpenſt with me in the Queſtion you now propoſe ſo preſſingly. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have ſaid nothing but what the <hi>Fathers</hi> have ſaid for me, and hope if any man diſlike any thing, he will conſider before he condemn it, what it is to ſlight and oppoſe an Authority ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But now I am not only without the ſupport of Authority (for 'tis not to be expected a peremptory deciſion ſhould be found in the Fathers, of a Queſtion which entered not into the world till a good while after they had left it) but the face of Authority is on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide: not, but that I conceive the Queſtion fully decided to thoſe who mind Sence, not Words. For it appears very plainly in what I have already produc'd, That the Temporal Power moves in its own ſphere, both Supreamly and Independently; which is in truth the whole buſineſs. But yet, becauſe this word <hi>Indirect</hi> is not found in the Fathers, 'tis ſtill pretended that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:69"/> Queſtion is not decided by them, and thoſe who have appeared againſt that Power are for the moſt part <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited</hi> by Cenſures, and rendred ſo unfit to ſupport others, that they have not been able to uphold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: In my judgment not without partiality. For they were Men of Learning and Vertue, nor is any thing, that I know, laid to their charge, more then that they thought otherwiſe in this Point than they think at <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet they at <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time freely communicate with ſome, who think the ſame, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their thoughts, and own them in the face of the vvorld. However it be, I ſo much value the content of thinking my thought quietly to my ſelf, and letting others think as they pleaſe; of going unregarded on my own road, and let others ſtray as much as they will, without thinking my ſelf bound to ſet them right, that I know not any task you could enjoyn me, to which I have a greater averſion. And I muſt tell you frankly, that were there no more in the caſe than the bare ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of your curious humour, I would intreat you to ſatisfie it at ſome other rate than the quiet of your Friend, and putting him out of his eaſie road, and ſetting him to ſtrive againſt the ſtream. But, ſince with a kind of malicious importunity you profeſs to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret my Silence to the diſadvantage of the Church, I muſt run the hazard of being perhaps traduc'd my ſelf, rather than ſuffer her to be ſo, and think my ſelf oblig'd to ſacrifice my Humour and inconſiderable Concerns to Her honour and ſervice. Wherefore, ſince there is no remedy, but I muſt ſwallow this ungrateful Pill; I pray God make it as wholſome, as I find it bitter.</p>
                     <p>To begin then, 'Tis too much known that there is a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attributed to the Pope by ſome, more than is thought due by others, and more than ſome Popes themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for 'tis written of <hi>Pius Vth.</hi> that he blam'd the groundleſs flattery. Theſe Favourers of the Pope are divided into two branches, Some giving him an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Direct Power over all, both Spirituals and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: Others reſtraining his Direct Power to Spirituals,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106994:69"/> but extending it to Temporals too, in as much as they have reference to Spirituals. The former is call'd the opinion of the Canoniſts, they being moſt of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion who hold it: the later is the opinion of Divines who generally go this way. Now if there were nothing in the caſe, but the Authority of the Maintainers, and ſtrength of the Reaſons by which they maintain it, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might diſpute with freedom, and let the ſtrongeſt Argument carry it. But Popes have taken part, and own'd this Power; and though they have not determin'd either the way or the thing, yet they take it for granted they have it ſome way, and proceed upon it. By this means it has got the face of Authority, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reverence we bear our Chief Paſtour; as it inclines many to think well of all that is favourable to him, ſo it awes the reſt, who do not, into a ſhineſs of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it. So that of Learned Men, thoſe who write of this Subject write generally in favour of it, thoſe who think otherwiſe, chuſe other Subjects to write of; as in truth, there is but little reaſon to diſguſt Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers meerly to ſhew there Learning. But this reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been ſo much taken notice of, that long ſince it has been thought neceſſary, Learned Men ſhould be conſtrain'd by Oaths and fear of Penalties, <hi>terribilibus comminationibus,</hi> to declare their thoughts of this matter. Poſſibly Intereſt may have had ſome ſhare in this back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs. Men of this ſort of Learning belong moſt to the Church, and may peradventure conſider, that, If they diſpleaſe him who carries the Keys, he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make uſe of them to ſhut the Gates of Eccleſiaſtical preferment. Beſides, they have been diligent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance and ſuppreſs all Books written againſt the Popes Power, ſo that a Private man cannot write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hazard of a Cenſure on his Book, and poſſibly on his Perſon. Theſe I think are the true Reaſons, I am ſure they are good ones, of the backwardneſs which you phanſie proceeds from a prohibition of the Church, and with a great deal of injuſtice; and no truth, heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into malice, and the execrable hypocriſie of teaching
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:70"/> two Religions, one to be publiſhed, the other conceal'd, and I know not what; when all this while, I aſſure you, there is no ſuch thing as a Prohibition of the Church, at leaſt that I know of, for any man to ſpeak what he thinks (what <hi>Fiſher</hi> mentions was a private Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made amongſt the Jeſuites, and concerns only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,) but wiſe men are not forward to ſpeak what may turn to their prejudice, nor quiet men to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the concerns of higher and the Higheſt Powers, as I conceive, they are not therefore blameable. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, He, who from the Sence of thoſe who have vvrit, would infer the Sence of all Learned Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, in my opinion, very fallaciouſly: Thoſe who Write not, and whoſe Sence we know not, being much more Numerous, and every jot as Learned as thoſe who Write.</p>
                     <p>But to let that paſs: this Doctrine has found a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reception in the world. The <hi>French,</hi> as their natures are frank and open, without more adoe plainly deny it; and beſides, a great many reiterated Arreſt of Parliament, have ſolemnly condemn'd it in all their Univerſities. In other Countries they are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and rather oppoſe, the Execution of the Power; than, the Power it ſelf. They let the Pope, and any for him, talk as they pleaſe, but when it comes to Practice, it alwaies proves unjuſt in that particular, and, I believe, alwaies ſhall do. In <hi>Brabant</hi> the Cuſtom is, That all <hi>Bulls</hi> are underſtood of courſe to be Subreptitious, till they be approv'd by the Prince: In other places; they have other expedients: but as far as I ſee, by ſeveral means they all compaſs the ſame end, and admit no more than they think ſtands with their Profit: Only the <hi>French</hi> bluntly tell the Pope, <hi>You cannot;</hi> others uſe ſofter words, but their Actions ſay, <hi>You ſhall not,</hi> farther than we think fit. Now for the Opinion of the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> ſince Divines univerſally reject it, I may without more adoe reject it with them. Of the other it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, Whether it be of Faith; and, Whether it be True, which are very different Queſtions. And for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106994:70"/> Faith, I poſitively and freely diſclaim it, both becauſe the Maintainers of it themſelves confeſs it is not, and though ſome are unwary enough to heighten it to that degree, yet they are but few, and their raſhneſs is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally condemn'd as ill grounded, and carried too far. And beſides, I ſee the contrary is openly maintain'd by as numerous and conſiderable a Member as any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Catholic Church; and while at <hi>Rome</hi> they condemn <hi>Withrington</hi> and <hi>Barklay,</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> The Pope and the reſt of the vvorld knows and ſees this, and yet Communicate freely with them, and account them all the while good Catholics. Which is plainly to acknowledge, it is no point of Faith in which they differ, for if it were, they could no more Communicate with them, than with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> or <hi>Pelagius;</hi> neither is any conſideration of their Power, or concern of Policy, able to juſtifie or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with acknowledging him a Catholic, who perſiſts to maintain an Hereſie. All the difficulty is, Whether it be true or no. And who am I, that I ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to dogmatize in an Age ſo Antidogmatical, and where no vanity is thought greater than that of Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing: and this in a Queſtion which has exerciſed the Wit and Learning of Men eſteem'd ſo great, that to oppoſe them may chance be counted Arrogance? The moſt I can do is to tell you what I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what I think is, even in my own judgment, ſo inconſiderable, that I think it a great deal better to play the Hiſtorian, than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter; and hope you will be ſatisfied, if I inform you as much as I know of this Queſtion, and relate the Arguments hitherto produc'd on both ſides; at leaſt, as far as I am acquainted with them, and leave you to judge as you ſee cauſe. By this means, as you will have all the Information I can give you, ſo none can rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally blame me for barely relating what every body either knows already, or may know, that will take the pains to look upon what is publickly and every where extant.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:71"/>
                     <p>But before I begin the Arguments, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to look a little into the Origin of this Diſpute, and conſider when, and how it came into the vvorld. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the VIIth. was the firſt that brought it on the Stage. Till his time the Independent Power of Princes was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtioned. They not only quietly diſpos'd of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters without controll, except where any noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Injuſtice happened (and then both Popes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther zealous Prelates took the liberty to reprehend, and ſometimes Excommunicate them) but had no ſmall ſhare in Eccleſiaſtical matters, ſo far as to make Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, to inveſt the Perſons duly choſen to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and confirm the Election even of Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was not held valid without their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Take it in the words of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> no enemy to this Pope.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Though formerly the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>were reſpected as the Heads of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, the Vicars of Chriſt, and Succeſſors of</hi> Peter, <hi>yet their Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no farther, than either to aſſert, or maintain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith. For the reſt, they were ſubject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, all things were done by Their appointment; Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were Created by them; neither did the Pope dare to judge, or determine any thing concerning them.</hi> Gregory <hi>the</hi> VIIth <hi>was the First of all the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>who relying on the Arms of the</hi> Normans, <hi>and Wealth of the Counteſs</hi> Mathildis, <hi>a Woman of great Power in</hi> Italy, <hi>and inflam'd by the diſcord of the Princes of</hi> Germany <hi>oppreſt with Civil Wars, contemning, contrary to the Custom of his Predeceſſours, the Imperial Power and Authority, after he had obtain'd the</hi> Pontificate, <hi>durſt, not only Excommunicate, but deprive the Emperour (by whom he had been if not Elected, at least Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd) of his Kingdom and Empire.

His Enemies give him the Character of an Imperious, Tyrannical, and ſeveral waies Wicked Man: his Friends on the other ſide praiſe him as much, and affirm he was a man of great Prudence and Vertue, and ſo far, that it hath been atteſted by ſeveral Miracles. And for my own part, I muſt confeſs, I incline to believe well of him. For he had been the ſupport of the Papacy during the time of ſeveral Popes, his Parts and Induſtry having drawn upon him the greateſt weight of all buſineſs, and was ſo far from aſpiring to that dignity, that, if <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ſay true, He treated with the Emperour not to conſent to his Election, aſſuring him before hand, that if he did, He would be very ſevere againſt the Abuſes practic'd in his Court. Beſides, if <hi>Sigonius</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and the paſſages he relates, vvhich can hardly be read vvithout horrour, the Emperour was a very Wicked Man: but that which concerns this matter was, That all Benefices were, with all the Licentiouſneſs of a depraved Court expos'd to ſale, and He that could Fee a Courtier was vvithout Merit, or even Capacity, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the moſt conſiderable Preferments of the Church. As this vvas a miſchief palpably deſtructive to all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo 'tis not incredible from the irregularity of a debauch'd Court. And if the Pope deſir'd to have it remedied, the end he propos'd was but what became him, if the means had been ſo too. I am the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe this true, becauſe the <hi>Germans</hi> in a great meaſure took part with the Pope, forct the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to comply, and after ſeveral Traverſes, at laſt took the Crown from him, and plac'd it on his Son. However it were, the Emperour, notwithſtanding the Popes Remonſtrances, gives conſent to the Election and confirms him; and the Pope was as good as his word. And firſt Excommunicates thoſe who ſhould receive Inveſtitures of Benefices from Laymen, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Laymen who ſhould grant them, and laſtly, provok'd by the Emperour, who in a Synod at <hi>Wormes</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:72"/> had forbidden Obedience to him, Excommunicates and depoſes the Emperour himſelf. And this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the firſt unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Example of this kind, which has appear'd in the Chriſtian World. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed, and his Followers, would make us believe there are Examples more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but in my opinion he proves them not well, and you ſee <hi>Onuphrius</hi> counts them but Fables: and thoſe of that Age, at leaſt thoſe vvho favoured the Emperour, exclaim'd againſt it as a Novelty unheard of; not to call it Hereſie as one faies. But though the thing were now done, it appears not yet in vertue of what Power 'twas done. As that Age was not, I think, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſubtle, the diſtinctions of Direct and Indirect Power were not yet found out, and the Pope himſelf ſpeaks in common, <hi>That the care of the Chriſtian World, and Authority to bind and looſe was committed to him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in the Judgment and Mercy of God, and Patronage of the B. Virgin, and ſupported by the Authority</hi> (of SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>) &amp;c. but deſcends not to particulars. So that it appears not whether he acted in vertue of a Spiritual or Temporal Power, Directly or Indirectly, and 'tis likely he ſpeculated not ſo far. One thing is pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in his ſecond Sentence, for he made two, which ends in this manner: After he had commanded all concerned, to withdraw their Obedience from <hi>Henry,</hi> and yield it to <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> ſpeaking as he does all along to the Apoſtles SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul: You then,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See the words in <hi>Platina.</hi>
                        </note> ſaies he, <hi>moſt holy Princes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles confirm what I have ſaid by your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that all men at laſt may underſtand, if you can bind and looſe in Heaven, we likewiſe on Earth may give and take away Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mortals can have.— Let Kings, and all Princes of the World understand by his Example what you can do in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and what power you have with God, and hereafter fear to contemn the commands of the Holy Church. And ſhew this Judgment upon</hi> Henry <hi>quickly, that all Sons of Iniquity may perceive that he falls from his Kingdom, not by chance, but by your means. This nevertheleſs I deſire from you, that by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:72"/> Repentance he may, at your requeſt, find favour of our Lord at the day of Judgment.</hi> For my part I cannot imagine, but a man who ſpeaks thus muſt needs mean uprightly, and think at leaſt he does well. Notwithſtanding the Apoſtles did not do as he deſir'd them. For this <hi>Rudul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> after he had fought twice upon equal terms with the Emperour, was overthrown in the third Battle, and ſo wounded in the right hand that he dy'd of it, and dy'd full of Repentance and acknowledgment of his own fault, and the Juſtice of God, who had deſervedly puniſht him in that hand with which he had formerly ſworn Fealty and Service to his Lord. So, that though I believe the Pope thought himſelf much in the right; yet the Court of Heaven thought not fit to grant his Requeſt, but ordered things quite contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and deſire.</p>
                     <p>The next famous Example is of <hi>Frederic</hi> the IId. a Prince of great Power and Parts, who falling out with ſeveral Popes as reſolute as himſelf, after ſeveral breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es at ſeveral times made up, and ſeveral Sentences pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, and recall'd, and renew'd again, was at laſt, <hi>with the aſtoniſhment and horrour of all preſent,</hi> ſaies M. <hi>Paris,</hi> ſolemnly Excommunicated and depos'd in the Councel of <hi>Lions.</hi> And this made both Princes and Prelates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to look about them, foreſeeing, that if this depoſing Power ſhould go on, a ſlight Pretence might at laſt ſerve turn to unthrone perhaps an Innocent Man, and bring the vvorld into confuſion; which poſſibly was the cauſe, the Popes Sentence was not executed. For this <hi>Frederic,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe proceedings, kept the Empire till his death, which happened long after. But ſtill I ſee not any ground to judge, whether the Power were yet thought Direct or Indirect; and in likelyhood, People had in common a great Veneration for the Supream Paſtour, and his Decrees, and thought them wicked men vvho ſubmitted not to them, but what kind of Power he had, and hovv far it extended, as far as I can perceive they little conſidered. 'Tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both in this Sentence, and the former of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:73"/> that the Emperour is firſt Depoſed, and afterwards Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, in aggravation as it were of the former Penalty.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs was a little more diſcuſt in the Conteſts betwixt <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIIIth. and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> As this Pope is Recorded for a man of more mettle than Vertue, his proceedings were Violent; but having to do with a Prince both Reſolute and Prudent, he found but bad ſucceſs. The Pope perſwades the King to an expedition into the Holy Land: to promote vvhich bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, He exacts the Tithes of Church Livings in <hi>France,</hi> and reſerves the Collation of all Benefices there to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The King excuſes the one, and plainly denies the other. The hot Pope ſends the Biſhop of <hi>Apamea</hi> to threaten him with Cenſures, and Depoſition, unleſs he yielded to him. The King calls the States, and upon Conſultation with them, reſolves the Legat deſerv'd to be impriſoned; but for reverence to the See Apoſtolic, baniſhes him, and for his Threats contemns them. The Legat not content to ſcape ſcot-free, falls a new to Threats, which the King reſenting commits him to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody to the Metropolitan. The Pope complains of the breach of Eccleſiaſtical Immunity, and commands his Legat ſhould be immediately return'd. Theſe Letters being read in an Aſſembly of the States, the Count of <hi>Arras,</hi> as hot every jot as the Pope, throws them into the fire. This put the Pope quite out of patience. Wherefore he Cites both King and Biſhops to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had appointed a Synod, and in the mean time declares the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> for Contumacy, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and Violating the Law of Nations devolved to the Apoſtolic See, writing thus peremptorily to the King; <hi>We would have you to know, that you are ſubject to us both in Spirituals and Temporals—and who thinks otherwiſe we repute Heretics.</hi> The King, upon the receipt of theſe Letters, calls the States again, and by their Advice frames an Anſwer every jot as ſmart, and ſomething more homely. <hi>We would have your fooliſhneſs know, we are ſubject to none in Temporals—and who thinks otherwiſe we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:73"/> take for mad men:</hi> And withal appeals to a future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel, and objects ſeveral Crimes to the Pope, to be made good when the Councel ſhould ſit, and in the mean time forbids all intercourſe vvith <hi>Rome.</hi> This Anſwer being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> by three Biſhops deputed for that purpoſe, the Pope began to be ſtartled, and at laſt confeſſes, That to uſurp the Kings Juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to him; nevertheleſs that in reſpect of Sin, the King could not deny but he was ſubject to the Pope. This put them to examine, how far, and in what manner he was ſubject to him; and one of the Cardinals in a Conſiſtory, in which the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, reſolves the caſe in this manner: That Supream Dominion belong'd properly to the Pope, but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to Kings; and therefore all Chriſtian Kings vvere ſubject to the judgment of the Pope even in Temporals, in regard of his Supream Dominion. But this ſatisfi'd not the Embaſſadours at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the States in <hi>France,</hi> reſuming the Debate, declar'd poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the King in Temporals vvas ſubject to God alone, and ow'd his Crown and Power only to him. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, this Subjection on the account of Sin, ſeems to be the ground of the diſtinction betwixt Direct and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct Power, though I conceive it borrowed from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the IVth. ſome time before, upon occaſion of a Conteſt betwixt <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Philip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> vvho proſecuting the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for default of Homage for ſome Dukedoms in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. King <hi>John</hi> appeals to the Pope; <hi>Philip</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that being a Temporal buſineſs he had nothing to do vvith it. The Pope was vvilling to favour the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore aſſumes cogniſance of the Cauſe, upon pretence that there was an Oath in the caſe, the violation of vvhich, being Sin, belong'd properly to his Tribunal. And this Reſolution having been put into a Decree, and that Decree into the Canon-Law ſeems the principal foundation of Indirect Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:74"/>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, I do not well underſtand how either this Canon which is in the Decretals, <hi>C. Novit Ille. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis;</hi> or the other, <hi>C. per Venerabilem. Qui filii ſint legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timi,</hi> which are the two uſually cited both of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. make to the purpoſe. The former was made upon the occaſion now mentioned, and in it the Pope ſpeaks thus: <hi>We intend not to Judge of the Fee, whereof the cogniſance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him</hi> (the King)—<hi>but to decree of the Sin, whereof the Cenſure without doubt pertains to us, which we may and ought to exerciſe on every one.— None of ſound Judgment is ignorant that it belongs to our Office, to correct every Chriſtian for any mortal Sin, and, if he deſpiſe Correction, to constrain him by Eccleſiaſtical puniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Pope ſaies <hi>Correct,</hi> the Gloſs adds <hi>Indirectly,</hi> which ſingle word, and that not explicated, is the main Authority for the diſtinction of <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Indirect</hi> Power now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other Canon <hi>per Venerabilem</hi> was made upon this occaſion. <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had put away his Wife, and taken, as I remember, the Counteſs of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and had Children by her. Theſe Children, at his requeſt, the Pope Legitimates, while the ſuit yet depended of the validity of his former Marriage; For the King alledged it was invalid. But as the Example of Kings is apt to be follow'd, Some body leaves his Wife too, and has Children by another Woman, and then ſollicites the Pope to Legitimate them as he had done the King's, The Pope refuſes to yield his Requeſt, but withal owns a Power to have granted it, if he had found it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and proves it by ſeveral Arguments; and amongſt other paſſages has theſe words: <hi>We exerciſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juriſdiction, not only in the Patrimony of the Church (where we have full power in Temporals) but in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries alſo, caſually upon inſpection of certain Cauſes.</hi> Theſe <hi>certain Cauſes</hi> the Gloſs interprets to be when He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Now both theſe Caſes ſeem to me far enough from the inferring the Depoſing Power, which was not at all in queſtion, but Legitimation in the one, and Cogniſance of a Temporal buſineſs in the other: And though the Pope aſſume both, yet he is very ſollicitous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:74"/> to prove they are within his Sphere, as both may be, and yet nothing follow in behalf of his Indirect diſpoſing. For he may Legitimate Children, in order to Spiritual capacities, and leave them in the ſame condition in which they were before as to Inheritance, and other Temporal concerns. Again, He may Judge of Sin, and puniſh it in his own Court with Spiritual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and let Temporal puniſhments alone to whom they belong, the Temporal Magiſtrate. And ſince he expreſly limits himſelf to Eccleſiaſtical puniſhments, methinks it is to ſtrain Logic a little to far to infer out of them, a right to Puniſh by Depoſition.</p>
                     <p>However, in my opinion, this difference in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Explicating this Power ſometimes <hi>Caſualiter,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Indirecte,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Ratione peccati,</hi> which differ ſufficiently, though they Cite the Authorities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as if they were all one, is a ſign they were at firſt not very cleer in this buſineſs, in Explicating which they hit it no better. Notwithſtanding, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct Power has at laſt got the Vogue, and moſt of the Learned Men who Write in favour of the Pope ſtick to that way. As <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is the moſt famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and moſt at hand, I chooſe his Arguments, believing as he was a Man of great Reading, he fail'd not to make uſe of all that was conſiderable in thoſe who Writ before him, and ſeeing, thoſe who Write ſince borrow moſt from him. He has Five in his Book, <hi>De Rom. Pont.</hi> and Four in his Anſwer to <hi>Barklay.</hi> The Firſt are Anſwered by <hi>Barklay,</hi> and better by <hi>Withrington,</hi> and every one who Writes of this Subject takes notice of them. In Anſwering I make uſe chiefly of <hi>Withrington,</hi> inſerting only upon occaſion what I find in others. Only to indulge ſomething to my fancy, and eaſe it of the grievous pain of Tranſcribing, I neither tie my ſelf to the order, nor preciſeneſs of the Arguments, but make entire Arguments of themſelves, what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor meant ſometimes a proof of ſome part of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument going before. While you have the Subſtance I hope you will allow me a little Variety for my own eaſe.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:75"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> then, After he had taught againſt the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> That the Spiritual and Civil Power are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſtinct, and have different Offices, different Ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when theſe two meet together, then he affirms they make but one Commonwealth, in which the Spiritual Power is ſuperiour to the Temporal: <hi>For,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>there cannot be two Heads, and therefore one Power muſt of neceſſity be ſubject to the other, when they both Club into one Commonwealth. But this they do where the Law of Chriſt is receiv'd, For we being many are one Body in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>And in one Spirit we were all baptiz'd into one Body.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. <hi>And becauſe the Members of the ſame Body must depend one of another, and Spirituals cannot be ſaid to depend on Temporals, Temporals muſt depend on Spirituals, and be ſubject to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this they Anſwer differently. Some granting the Spiritual and Temporal Power make but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, affirm the Members independent one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as the Hand depends not on the Foot, nor the Foot on the hand, but each free and abſolute in their proper Functions, are ſubject only to the Supream Head <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Others, in my opinion more rationally, deny the Two Powers club into one Commonwealth, and ſay, The Spiritual makes one, and the Temporal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and to many others as there are Independent Heads of this Power: That the ſame men in different reſpects make both theſe Bodies; and that as Clergy, and Laity, and all, not excepting the Prince himſelf, in as much as they are Faithful, are ſubject to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power, according to the nature of Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; ſo the ſame Laity and Clergy, not excepting the Pope himſelf, in as much as they are Citizens and parts of the Temporal Commonwealth, are ſubject to the Temporal Power; that is, for as much as concerns the Law of God purely, and abſtracting from Humane Conſtitutions, and ſuch Changes as time has brought into the World. For now the Pope is himſelf an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Prince, and other Clergy Men have Priviledges and Immunities juſtly belonging to them. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:75"/>
'tis aſſumed that the Church is one Body, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh this word <hi>Church,</hi> and ſay if it be taken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, that is, the Faithful under the notion of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then indeed they make but one Body; but neither doth this Body include both Powers, for 'tis only the Spiritual to which they are ſubject as Faithful; as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, they belong to the Temporal. But if the word <hi>Church</hi> be taken Materially, for the Men which make up the Church (an Acception ſomething improper, but yet ſuch as comprehends both Powers) then ſay they, In this ſence the Church is not one Body but two, or if you vvill twenty, as many as there are ſeveral Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Temporal Powers in Chriſtendom; One <hi>Spiritual</hi> in relation to the Spiritual Power, and which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Church; The reſt <hi>Temporal</hi> in relation to their ſeveral Temporal Heads. And this Anſwer, as it ſeems fair in it ſelf, and juſtified by the ſence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Mankind (for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both acknowledge the Pope, and are both parts of the Church, and that one Body of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks; but he that ſhould therefore think them not to be Two diſtinct Bodies, and Independent Common-wealths, would be thought ſomething extravagant.) ſo 'tis a little more ſtrongly inforc'd againſt <hi>Bellarmin</hi> by other parts of his own Doctrine. For he teaches elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, That Church-men, beſides that they are Church-men, are alſo Citizens and parts of the Civil Common-wealth, and that all Members of every Body muſt be ſubject to their reſpective Head: That the Civil and Spiritual Power are in their nature diſtinct Powers, and have diſtinct Offices and Ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Chriſt did diſtinguiſh the Dignities and Offices of Pope and Emperour, that one ſhould not preſume upon the Rights of the other; That Chriſtian Princes, as well as Infidels, acknowledge no Superiour in Temporals, ſince Chriſt took not away the Rights of any, and a King by becoming a Chriſtian loſes no Right he had before, and the like. Beſides, this Anſwer ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſtrengthned by ſome Authorities mentioned in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:76"/> the former Letters. Such as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Prelates of the Church owe you all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And again: <hi>The Biſhops themſelves are to obey your Laws, and that, becauſe there are Two principal Powers by which the World is Governed, the Sacred Authority of Biſhops, and Regal Power.</hi> Likewiſe Pope <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> to the ſame Emperour. <hi>Biſhops are ſubject to the Laws of the Prince in what concerns Public Diſcipline, and Princes to Biſhops in the diſpenſation of the Myſteries and Sacraments,</hi> according to the famous Canon of <hi>Leo</hi> the IV. Nos ſi incompetenter. <hi>It is to be noted that there are Two Perſons by which this world is governed, The</hi> Regal, <hi>and</hi> Sacerdotal: <hi>as Kings are Chief in Worldly, ſo Prieſts in Divine matters. — There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> David, <hi>though by his Regal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction he were over Prieſts and Prophets in affairs of the World, yet was under them in thoſe of God.</hi> Much more might be alledged on this Subject, but this I conceive is enough to ſhew the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> has the ſupport of Authority as well as Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>A Second Argument is from the ends of both Powers, <hi>whereof one being Eternal, the other Temporal happineſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Eternal happineſs is the Supream and Laſt end of all things, Temporal happineſs muſt be ſubordinate to it: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>where the Ends are ſubordinate, the Faculties likewiſe are ſubordinate, the Civil Power which aims only at Temporal happineſs muſt be ſubordinate, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Spiritual, which looks after Eternal.</hi> This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they Anſwer likewiſe two waies; Firſt by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole, which they ſay concludes nothing againſt them. For admitting the Temporal Power to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Spiritual, nothing follows more than than 'tis under the other according to the Order which the other has over it, which is by the way of Inſtruction, and Perſwaſion, and Direction, not by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion; For that belongs not to Spiritual Power. Let the Prince, ſay they, in Gods name, be Inſtructed by the Prelate to do well, and Admoniſht, and if it be ſeaſonable, even vvith Spiritual Cenſures be Corrected if he do amiſs: all this may be, and is done by zealous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:76"/> Prelates without prejudicing the Authority of the Prince. But if they proceed to Authoriſe his Subjects to throw off their Obedience, then they exceed, ſay they, the bounds of their Spiritual Power, and intrench upon another which belongs, not to them, but the Prince, and in which he is ſubject neither to them, nor any body, but God. Another way they Anſwer, by denying the Ends of thoſe Two Powers to be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one to the other. For the Laſt end of every Power is its proper act, as Sight is the laſt end of the power to ſee, and Reliſh of the power to taſte, and ſo Temporal Happineſs of Temporal Power. Indeed he vvho has Temporal Power, ought to have, and has if he be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, a farther end and aim at Eternal happineſs, both in the uſe of his Temporal power, and all the Actions he does. But the end of the Power is one thing, and the end of Him that has the power another. Wherefore though the Man be ſubject, his Power is not. Eternal happineſs is indeed his own laſt end, but the laſt end of Power is Peace, and the quiet ſecurity of his Subjects, nor is there any other end to vvhich his Power is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> againſt <hi>Barklay</hi> endeavours to make this Argument good, by the Subjection which all Arts in a Commonwealth have to the great Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where the Painter, the Muſician, the Mariner, and the reſt, are all directed, ſo to uſe their ſeveral Arts, as is moſt fitting for the end of the Prince, and good Government, vvhich is Superiour to them all: And as theſe are ſubject to the King, and muſt obey vvhat he preſcribes even in the Uſe of their Arts, ſo King and all, ſaies he, is ſubject to the Pope as He who profeſſes the higheſt of Arts, the bringing Souls to Heaven, by vvhich all inferiour Arts, and their Uſe, is to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. They Reply, that this rather confirms than op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes what they ſay. Thoſe Artiſts are indeed all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Supream Artiſt the Prince, but as Citizens, not as Artiſts. The Men are ſubject to him, and obliged to obey his Commands even in the Uſe of their Arts, but their Arts have not therefore any ſubordination to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:77"/> his Art. The Ends of Arts or Faculties, ſay they, are then ſubordinate when one is deſigned for the ſervice of another. As the Brick-maker to the Maſon, the Sadler to the Horſe-man, and the like. For if there were no Houſes, nor Riding, Bricks and Saddles would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In theſe caſes the Faculties are ſubordinate becauſe the Ends are ſo, and the Brick-maker muſt receive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from the Maſon how to make his Bricks, and the Sadler from the Rider, what kind of Saddle to make. But that a Painter ſhould be inſtructed by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour how to manage his Colours, or a Muſician his Proportions, or that theſe things have any dependence on the Art of Governing, they think a fancy a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Learning. <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rule then, ſay they, is very true; And Faculties are ſubordinate, where the Ends of them are ordained one for another: but vvhere the Ends are Ends of the Men, and not of the Faculties, there is no colour to alledge it. And ſo it happens in this caſe, For though Eternal happineſs be the Laſt end of all men, yet 'tis no more the end of Temporal Power, than Taſte is the end of ſeeing, or Sight of taſting, both which the man makes uſe of to his own good, but they are independent and unſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one to the other. So as the Painter and Muſician are ſubject to the King as Citizens, not as Artiſts; ſo the King is ſubject to the Pope, not as King, but as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and no otherwiſe ſubject than as Chriſtianity obliges him, with vvhich it may very vvell ſtand, That vvhile He is ſubject to the Pope in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> the Pope may be ſubject to him in <hi>Temporals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Argument is, from the Perfection of Commonwealths, and conſequently the Church in as much as it is a Commonwealth. <hi>Every Commonwealth,</hi> ſaies Bellarmin, <hi>muſt have Means ſufficient to attain its end, and the End of this Spiritual Commonwealth, which we call the Church, being the Salvation of Souls, the Church were not perfect in her kind if She wanted ſufficient Means to bring men to Salvation. And becauſe Wicked Princes may be a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the Salvation of Souls, the Church would want
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:77"/> ſufficient Means to attain her End, if She had not Power to remedy this inconveniency, and Depoſe them when they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibly obstinate.</hi> This Argument, to ſay the truth, they handle a little ſeverely. And firſt they make <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> himſelf anſwer it, putting inſtead of <hi>Wicked Princes, Wicked Popes,</hi> and then making uſe of it vvith as much efficacy to conclude that the Church has a Power to Depoſe Wicked Popes. But this he will by no means admit, and can therefore tell us,<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if in that caſe there be no efficacious Humane remedy in the Church, ſince its ſafety principally depends, not on Humane induſtry, but the Divine protection, Its King being GOD; Wherefore, though the Church cannot Depoſe the Pope, yet it can, and ought, pray that God will provide a remedy. And 'tis certain that God will take care of her ſafety, and either Convert, or take away, ſuch a Pope before he have ruin'd the Church.</hi> Now, they conceive People may as well have recourſe to God for remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Wicked King, as a Wicked Pope, and that He can as vvell hear them. However, want of efficacious Humane remedies in ſome eaſes, is acknowledged by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> to be no Argument of Imperfection in the Church, and therefore they think he might well have ſpared his pains in this particular. And, ſince the ſafety of the Church depends on the Protection of God, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in very good hands, and that there is no great danger the Wickedneſs of any Prince will prove more powerful than his Goodneſs, to which the ſafety of the Church may very ſecurely be truſted, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe. But they go farther, and ask, if this Power of the Church be ſo fully ſufficient to bring men to Salvation, how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that there is ſo much Ambition, and ſo much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and ſo much Gluttony, and ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the Fleſh, and of the Eyes, ſo much Pride of life ſtill left in the vvorld? For theſe things are great hinderances to Salvation, and the Church ſeems deficient in her Duty if She take them not away when ſhe can: Again, Why does not the Church, with her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:78"/> ſufficient Power, cleer the World from Mahumetiſm, and Infidelity, and Idolatry, which likewiſe are main obſtacles to Salvation, and provide for the ſafety of ſo many Millions as are loſt by them. Farther, Amongſt Chriſtians, A man commits a mortal Sin, and runs mad upon it. Has the Church ſufficient Power to reſtore this man to his Wits, that he may Repent and be ſaved? Can She hinder Abortions, and bring all Children alive to Baptiſm? And twenty other ſuch Croſs Queſtions they put. But to Anſwer the Argument more preciſely: They conſider this ſufficient Power in the Church, either in order to it Self, or in order to all things neceſſary to the Effect. Conſidering the Power in it ſelf, it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient for as much as is required on that ſide; but, becauſe to the Effect many things are required beſides ſufficient Power, or Efficacy in the Cauſe, as that the Subject be fitly diſpoſed, the Cauſe duly apply'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſay, a Defect in theſe things argues no inſufficiency in the Power, and the Power may be very ſufficient for as much as belongs to the Nature of Power, and yet the Effect not follow for want of ſome diſpoſition in the Subject. For Example, The Sun has ſufficient Power to enlighten the whole World, the Fire has ſufficient power to burn that ſtack of Wood, though the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not level a Mountain, which intercepts the courſe of his beams, nor the Fire has hands to bring the Wood to it, or legs to carry it to the Wood. Wherefore, they ſay, The Church has Power abundantly ſufficient to bring Men to Salvation, for as much as is requiſite on the part of Power, but 'tis a wild conceit to think She can remove all obſtacles which Nature or Chance caſts in her way to hinder the exerciſe of that Power. And if one of thoſe Obſtacles happen to be the Wickedneſs of a Prince, the Churches ſufficient Power to Save men can no more take Him away, than the Suns ſufficient power to ſhine level a Mountain. What her ſufficient Power, or Means to Save men are, we may learn from thoſe who certainly beſt know the end of the Church, and Means to attain it, the firſt Planters of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:78"/> who by there Example have inſtructed us, That efficacious Preaching, and more efficacious Living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy Doctrine they Preach'd, Charity, and Patience, and humble Zeal are the ſufficient Means which have prevailed upon the Converted vvorld, and when they are in Gods fit time duly apply'd, vvill be as ſufficient for the reſt. In the mean time we may learn of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that God vvill have a care of his Church; and, whatever he think, muſt think our ſelves, That Prayer is as good a remedy againſt a Bad Prince as a Wicked Popes: And therefore that Propoſition, which aſſumes that a Depoſing Power is neceſſary, or that the Churches Power would be Inſufficient without it, they flatly deny.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame Head <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Argues again. <hi>Every Commonwealth, becauſe it has Power ſufficient to preſerve it ſelf, and bring its Subjects to Temporal happineſs, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand another Commonwealth, which is not ſubject to it, to ceaſe from doing injury to her, and hinder her from the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her just Ends, and if it refuſe to Obey, may Depoſe the Prince of it, and ſet up another who will be more Juſt, in caſe there be no other way to avoid wrong from it. Therefore much more may the Spiritual Commonwealth command the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which is ſubject to it, and Depoſe the Prince, in caſe She cannot otherwiſe compaſs Her End, the Salvation of Souls.</hi> And this Argument they treat not more favourably than the former: For they ſay firſt, It aſſumes plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, vvhen it puts two Commonwealths both inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and free, and yet puts a Power in the one to command the other, which is to make that other Subject, and not Free. Again, It aſſumes without any reaſon, and againſt all Truth, That the Temporal Commonwealth is ſubject to the Spiritual, which they will by no means admit, unleſs perhaps of a Spiritual Subjection, and that too of the perſons as Faithful, not as a common-wealth, in which reſpect every abſolute Commonwealth is abſolutely free from all Subjection to any but God. Farther, they retort it as the former, and ſay, It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes as well a Power in the Temporal Commonwealth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:79"/> over the Spiritual as in the Spiritual over the Temporal. For, ſay they, The Temporal is a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth too, and has Power ſufficient to attain its End. Wherefore, if the Spiritual hinder her in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Her ends, She may command the Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to ſurceaſe; and if the Spiritual Prince prove Diſobedient, depoſe him and ſet up another, ſince the Spiritual Commonwealth is as ſubject to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral in Temporals, as the Temporal to the Spiritual in Spirituals. But, to Anſwer the Argument more directly, they deny that this forcible proceeding, of one Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Commonwealth with another, argues any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority or Subjection in either. What they do in this kind, if it be well done, being juſtified by the force of Nature, and light of Reaſon, and lawleſs Law of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, vvhich teaches Force to be then fitly us'd, when nothing but Force will compaſs an End, otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Otherwiſe this kind of Power, is no other than a Strong man has to take away the Purſe of a Weak one: and there is no doubt but whoever has it, may, if he vvill, make uſe of it, and ſo the Pope, if he be ſtrong enough, may certainly Depoſe a Prince, as a Prince may a Pope. But, they wonder <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould be ſo little conſiderative, as inſtead of a Power of juſt Authority, to talk of a power of Strength, in which they think he has done the Church but little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for if She come to vye with Princes in this kind of Power; the Material Sword, which belongs to them, will, in all likelyhood, wound the Spiritual Outward-man more ſenſibly, than the Spiritual Sword will the Carnal man. Mean time, they conceive he take a bad Method to conclude an Authoritative Power in the Church, by the example of a Power in Commonwealths, which is not Authority but Strength.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity, in this manner. <hi>It is not lawful for Chriſtians to endure an Infidel or Heretic Prince, of that Prince endeavour to draw his Subjects to Hereſie or Infidelity. But it belongs to the Pope to judge whether he be guilty of ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:79"/> drawing them or no, wherefore to the Pope it belongs to Judge whether he ought to be Depoſed or no.</hi> Becauſe he could not but foreſee his firſt Propoſition would be deny'd him, he provided Proofs, which before I meddle with I muſt inform you what they ſay to thus much of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for they are no where ſmarter. This, ſay they, is without more adoe, to put all Kingdoms into the Popes hands, and make him as Abſolute as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant of Canoniſts can fancy him. For ſince there are but two things conſiderable in the caſe, Whether an Opinion imputed to a Prince be Hereſie or no? and, Whether he hold it or no, and would introduce it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Subjects? If both theſe depend on the Popes Judgment, and his Judgment be irrafragable, the ſafety of all Princes lies in his breaſt, and no Prince can be longer ſecure of his Crown, than he is of the Popes favour? For the Pope may proceed to Judgment when he pleaſes, and if he be to be obey'd let him Judge how he pleaſes, No Prince can be a Prince longer than he pleaſes. For put the caſe, ſay they. To deny in the Pope a Power to Depoſe Princes is an opinion, which may, by this Rule, be declared Hereſie, whenever the Pope thinks convenient. The King of <hi>France,</hi> for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, himſelf holds that Opinion, and endeavours his Subjects ſhould do ſo to. This King therefore, and I believe it will go as hard with all the reſt, is Depoſable if for no other reaſon, yet for thinking himſelf not Depoſable. And ſo, all Kings are without more adoe at the Mercy of the Pope. If they acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Depoſable, they grant the Power, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him that he puts it not in Execution, if they deny it, for that very reaſon they are to be Depoſed, and are again more to thank him that he does not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, when they deſerve it. To this particular then of the Popes Judgment, If it be underſtood of a Natural Judgment, others, ſay they, may Judge as well as the Pope whether the Prince deſerve to be Depos'd or no, and thoſe who live upon the place better, as having better information from their Eyes and Ears,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:80"/> than he can have from the Report of others. But if it be underſtood of an Authoritative Judgment, ſuch whoſe Sentence obliges People to the Execution of it, they deny the Pope, or any elſe, has any Authority to Judge, in that manner, of the Behaviour of Princes. For, ſay they, the Authority of every Judge, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his proper Tribunal; a Judge of Aſſize is no Judge in the Spiritual Court, nor is a Biſhop a Judge of Aſſize. Now the Pope's is a Spiritual Tribunal, and in that he may, in fit circumſtances, judge even of Princes, and condemn them, if they be faulty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual Penalties againſt them. But if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Temporal Puniſhments, he paſſes to a Tribunal in which he is no Judge, nor his Sentence ſo given more to be obey'd than that of a Court Marſhal in the Common Pleas: And to ſay otherwiſe, were to take all Judges, and all Tribunals out of the vvorld, beſides his own. For there is no Action but if well done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Vertue, if ill, to Vice; And He being as much Judge of Vertue as Vice, as of Hereſie and Faith, there is no Action nor can be, which by this account does not belong to his Tribunal, and ſo all other Judges are uſeleſs. For the reſt, they flatly deny the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and affirm, Subjects are ſo far from being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to endure an Infidel, or Heretic Prince, that they are oblig'd to Endure and Obey him too, not ſo far indeed as to turn Infidels or Heretics for his ſake, nor ſo far as not to repreſent his Errours or Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to him in that dutiful manner which is allowed by the Law, and their Allegiance; but, for the reſt, let him be never ſo much an Infidel or Heretic, He is ſtill their Prince, and as ſuch to be obey'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> proves he may not from <hi>Deuteron.</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> are forbid to chooſe a King who is not a <hi>Jew:</hi> And this ſeems a little far off. For if in <hi>Poland,</hi> for Example, the Law were to chooſe only a <hi>Polander,</hi> or in <hi>Germany</hi> a <hi>German;</hi> this might very well be true, and withal be little to purpoſe. But yet he brings it nearer. <hi>The Reaſon of this Law,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>was, leaſt by chooſing a Stranger,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:80"/> they might be brought into Idolatry. But there is the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the ſame miſchief in chooſing a Prince who is not a Chriſtian, and remaining ſubject to one who becomes no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, therefore Chriſtians are bound to Depoſe a Prince who deſerts Chriſtianity, and endeavours to pervert his Subjects after him.</hi> This Argument, ſaies the other ſide, makes nothing for the Pope: It may ſeem to countenance the pretenſions which Rebellious People make to a Power over their Kings; for thoſe are they who Chooſe, and by Conſequence are to Depoſe, if this Argument hold; but the Pope has no more to do with the one than the other, or if he have he has as much right to Chooſe as Depoſe. For the <hi>Law</hi> then, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Reaſon, aſſigned by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> is in likelyhood true: but when he aſſumes that the caſe of not Chooſing, and not Obeying a Prince already choſen, or otherwiſe in Lawful poſſeſſion of the Principality, is equally miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, they think him wonderfully out. Before he is Choſen, he is no Prince, nor have the People any tye to him, and while they are at their Liberty they will not do well to Chooſe ill, and ſubject themſelves to a Bad Man. But when he is once Choſen, or otherwiſe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, they are no longer Free, but Subject, and that for Conſcience, neither have they any other part in the diſpoſition of the Commonwelth but Obedience. This Prince, though Election were the means by which he got his Principality, yet has it now, and that by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, and is truly the Vicar of God, whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Commiſſion for his Depoſition unleſs it can be produced, thoſe who reſiſt him <hi>reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and acquire Damnation to themſelves.</hi> A Man does ill who chooſes a Bad Wife, and is bound by the law of Reaſon to chooſe a Good one: But can he therefore caſt her off when he has her, and becauſe he did amiſs in taking a Scold, do worſe in leaving her? The Cardinals are bound to Chooſe a Good Man for Pope; if they chooſe a Bad one, or he become Bad after his Election, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> will not therefore allow them to Chooſe another. And yet his Argument is every jot as efficacious in that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:81"/> caſe, as in that of Bad Princes. A Bad Pope may do as much miſchief as a Bad Prince, and if the danger and miſchief be equal to Chooſe him, and Obey him, the Pope is as fully confuted as the Prince. But that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> ſhould impoſe upon them that the miſchief of Chooſing, and not Depoſing is equal, and make it a kind of known Principle too, and ſuch as needs no proof, they take very unkindly at his hands. For if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to chooſe a Bad Man, there is no miſchief at all, nor injury ſo much as to him who is refuſed. But if a Prince once lawfully Eſtabliſht be afterwards caſt out, there follows Bloodſhed, and War, the Hazard, perhaps the Ruine of the Commonwealth. So that his equal Caſes put the greateſt miſchiefs that can be on one ſide, and none at all on the other, which is a very partial, and ſomething unequal equality: or elſe, they make the Diſturbance and Hazard of the Commonwealth no miſchief, which, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, argues, he had more confidence in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic, than they have Opinion of his Judgment. 'Tis great pity this Doctrine, if it be true, was not in faſhion a little ſooner, the Ignorance of it coſt the life of many a good Chriſtian, and the Bloud of abundance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Men, ſhed in Ten Perſecutions, might have been ſaved, if the firſt Maſters of Chriſtianity had Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted People a little better, and made them underſtand the convenient uſe of their Power. For it had been but Antidating a little the courſe of Providence, and ſetting up a Chriſtian Emperour in the place of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and all had been well: And 'tis a little ſtrange thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, whom none ſuſpects of want of Zeal, either underſtood, or practis'd their duty no better.</p>
                     <p>Neither the one nor the other ſaies <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> but the Reaſon why they Depos'd not <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and the Apoſtate <hi>Julian,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> the Arian, was, becauſe they wanted Force. <hi>For that they wanted not Right nor the Knowledge of it, is apparent by the Apoſtle, who,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. <hi>bids the Chriſtians appoint New Judges, and if they could make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:81"/> New Judges, they might as well have made New Kings if their Force had been equal to their Juſtice.</hi> But certainly ſome body is extreamly out, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or his Adverſaries; for they affirm very confidently, that the Primitive Chriſtians were not ſo weak and helpleſs as he pretends. S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf liv'd in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, and he had power to reſtore the dead to life, and caſt the living into ſudden death. A body would think this was Power enough in conſcience, and that <hi>Nero</hi> with all his Guards and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions was not more ſecure of his Empire againſt this miraculous and unreſiſtable Force, than <hi>Ananias</hi> of his life. It was not then for want of Power that he taught Chriſtians to be ſubject to the King as moſt excelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chooſe to lay down his own life amongſt the reſt, rather then practice an expedient which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> thinks ſo neceſſary, and which to him had been eaſie enough if he had been of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> mind. But to ſpeak only of Humane Power, <hi>Tertullian</hi> liv'd in thoſe daies, and Writ what he ſaw and knew; He affirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> thinks very plainly, <hi>Apologet.</hi> C. 37. <hi>Should we want Numbers or Forces if we had a mind to be open Enemies, not ſecret Revengers?

                     <p>To the Proof which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> they Reply, That ſince the Chriſtians had Force enough to Create New Judges, they ſee not why they had not Force enough to Create New Kings too. And the truth is, if the Judges meant by the Apoſtle, were ſuch as could claim and exerciſe the Authority, inveſted in thoſe who were appointed by the Prince, it was little leſs than to ſet up New Kings, or at leaſt deprive their Old of a good part of the Subjection due to them. For he that refuſes to ſubmit to a Magiſtrate Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Prince, makes more bold with the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than is conſiſtent with the duty of a Subject. For ſince the Inferiour Judge has his Authority from the Prince, to refuſe it is in plain terms to refuſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prince. Which the Apoſtle, they think, was far enough from Authorizing, or even perſwading, Chriſtians to do. They conceive then, that what the Apoſtle did in this caſe, is no more than what Good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:82"/> Judges ought to do at this day, it being no unuſual thing for them to wiſh the parties not to expect the Rigour of the Law, but compound their Differences fairly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, to which purpoſe they either Aſſign, or leave them to chooſe Umpires themſelves. Yet, all this while never intend, by their Charitable Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to forfeit their own Right, or debar the Parties from having recourſe to them again, if the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod proves not to their ſatisfaction. Such, ſay they, was the Apoſtles meaning in that place. He deſired to prevent, as much as might be, all Contentions among the Faithful, at leaſt the Scandal of their breaking out, and being taken notice of in the Courts of Heathens. To this purpoſe he wiſhes them to keep their Frailties from becoming public, and if they could not avoid Contentions, at leaſt to end them by the Judgment of Men choſen amongſt themſelves; but never intended to inveſt the Men ſo choſen, with an Authority any way prejudicial to that of the lawful Magiſtrate. Even now, ſay they, the Apoſtles whether Counſel or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſtill in force, and People do ill who expoſe their Frailties to the knowledge of Public Courts; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if they will needs go to Law, Courts have their full Power now as they had then, and as much as if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had never written any ſuch thing. By the Judges then mentioned by the Apoſtle, they underſtand <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires</hi> choſen among themſelves to prevent the Scandal of Public Suits, but without any Authority derogatory to the Public Magiſtrate, and alledge from S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> That if the Faithful had been forbidden to appear upon Summons before the Tribunals of Infidels, it had been againſt the ſubjection due to Princes, and contrary to the Command of S. <hi>Peter, Be ſubject to every humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the King as precelling, and to the Rulers as ſent by him. Bellarmin</hi> cannot digeſt this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage,</hi> but perſiſts againſt <hi>Barklay</hi> to maintain they were True Judges, yet withal confeſſes they had no Coactive Power as to the External Court, and that Chriſtians were obliged, when ever Cited at the Suit, either of Infidel or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:83"/> to anſwer before the Legal Magiſtrate; becauſe, ſaies he, they were not Choſen by conſent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties alone, but appointed by the Church. But this, I think, makes them no other than bare Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires; for ſuch they are, and are ſo eſteemed among us who are often appointed by our Court; to decide parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Differences. And all the obligation to ſtand to their Award, was, for ought appears, the obligation of doing what became Chriſtians, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, and our Saviour before him had inſtructed <hi>Not to contend in Judgment, but part with the Cloak too to him who would take away the Coat.</hi> And this Obligation, for ought I know, continues ſtill, and Law Suits are a blemiſh to the perfection of Chriſtianity even at this day, where men ſhould do a great deal better to decide their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences by a Friendly Compoſition, than loſe ſo much time, and undergo ſo much Trouble as is required to follow the Law. But if either We now, or They then, are not ſo perfect as we ought, but will have recourſe to Magiſtrates, there is nothing in S. <hi>Paul</hi> which hinders their Juriſdiction. Mean time I conceive, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Judge and an Umpire, is, that one has Power to execute his Sentence, the other not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> may call them what he pleaſes, but if they had no Coactive Power, as he confeſſes they had not, they were not what our, and I think all Languages, properly call <hi>Judges.</hi> This Argument then ſeems to come off lamely enough, while it ſuppoſes the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians wanted Force, againſt the plain teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Primitive Chriſtians themſelves; and would prove a right to ſet up New Kings, by ſetting up New Judges, vvhich Judges had not that Power vvhich is neceſſary to a Judge, and makes his proper diſtinction from an Umpire; however, vvhich did not prejudice the Authority of the Legal Magiſtrate. In ſhort, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, Chriſtians are now free from Subjection to their Princes, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do ſomething which did not take away their Subjection to Inferiour Magiſtrates:</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:83"/>
                     <p>Peradventure a ſecond Proof may be more lucky, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes in this manner. <hi>To tolerate an Heretical Prince, is to expoſe Religion to moſt evident danger. For ſuch as the Ruler of a City is, ſuch will be the Inhabitants.</hi> Eccleſiaſtic. 10. <hi>But Christians ought not to tolerate an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Prince with evident peril of Religion, becauſe where Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Laws are oppoſite, we muſt obey the Divine Law. And the Divine Law obliges us to preſerve the true Religion, Human Law only to have this, or that Man for King.</hi> And to ſay truth, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is a little more lucky than ordinary; for his Adverſaries, beſides vvhat he Cites from Scripture, grant him at leaſt one Propoſition, namely, That the Law of God is to be prefer'd before the Law of Man, and they hit it ſo ſeldom, that 'tis well they agree in any thing. But then they deny all the reſt, and affirm, that to tolerate an Infidel King, is not to expoſe Religion to evident danger; That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought be ſubject to the Prince God has ſet over him, whatever he be; That there is no Contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law of God, and the Law of Man in this caſe; and laſtly, That our Subjection to Princes is not only by Human Law. And while they are in ſuch an humour of Contradicting, 'twas great luck that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> could get any thing granted. For the firſt, they ſay, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> forgets himſelf and his Doctrine elſewhere. When 'twas for his purpoſe he could acknowledge, that <hi>The ſafety of the Church depends, not on Human Induſtry, but, the Divine Protection, and that he will be ſure to take care of her, and provide Remedies againſt all miſchances which may befall her.</hi> And they think, if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> be forgetful, there is no great fear that God will be ſo too, or danger that any Wickedneſs will prevail againſt the Power of Omnipotent Goodneſs. For what greater danger is there in theſe later daies, more than in the former, when for Three hundred years together Princes, not only were Infidels, but employ'd all their Power and all their Induſtry to root out Springing Chriſtianity out of the World. Notwithſtanding which, the Church continued, and increaſed, and prevail'd at laſt. So that,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:84"/> if a King happen to perſecute the Church, to think, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſeems to do, that all is preſently loſt, is to rely on the Arm of Fleſh a little more than becomes a good Chriſtian, and to diſtruſt either the Power or Goodneſs of God, and beſides, manifeſtly to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Evidence of Hiſtory. And for the ſecond, That People may not tolerate an Infidel Prince, becauſe that would expoſe Religion to evident Danger. This Tolerating of a Prince ſeems ſomething an unmannerly phraſe for Subjects. A Prince may, when he ſees fit, Tolerate the unwaywardneſs of his Subjects, and not puniſh all the faults he ſees. But for Subjects to Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Prince is an expreſſion hardly tolerable. They are to obey him, not in his Infidelity, which 'tis permitted them even to oppoſe by all the dutiful means conſiſtent with the Fidelity of good Subjects, but in the reſt to refuſe Subjection, is no leſs than to acquire damnation. However, <hi>Tolerating,</hi> ſay they, ſignifies not Acting, <hi>Expoſing</hi> ſignifies Acting; and that <hi>not-doing</hi> ſhould be thought <hi>Doing,</hi> they apprehend very ſtrange. Yet, if any Inconvenience follow from not Acting, it is then only imputable to him who Acts not, when He is otherwiſe obliged to Act. And no man can be oblig'd to Act, but where the Action is Juſt and Lawful. Now Rebellion, and Tumults, and Murther, and ſuch Actions as thoſe of neceſſity muſt be, by which a Lawful Prince is reſiſted by his Subjects, till <hi>Bellarmin</hi> have prov'd Juſt and Lawful Actions, they think, they may ſafely deny, any apprehended danger of Religion will juſtifie thoſe who do them. If any harm come, they are all accountable to God who do it; the People who do Nothing have nothing to Anſwer for, unleſs it be blamable to truſt Gods Providence, and not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle without ſufficient Cauſe, a ſufficient cauſe of Condemnation. If the Laws of God did warrant the Interpoſing of the People, ſomething might be ſaid for them; but ſince they do not; their part is to do their Duty in what concerns them to do, and rely upon God for the reſt. Then for the Contradiction between the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:84"/> two Laws: The Divine Law, ſaies <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> obliges us to preſerve the True Religion, Human only to have this or that Man for King. Where is the Contradiction, ſay they? Cannot I keep this Man for my King, and keep my Religion too? A body would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kink that this is very poſſible to be done. The contrary to that Divine Law is, You ſhall not preſerve the True Religion; and if any Human Law command this, Diſobey freely in God's name, for <hi>Aequum est obedire Deo magis quam Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus.</hi> But while you diſobey this Law, which you cannot without offending God obey, do not refuſe to acknowledge your Prince, and obey him there, where you offend God if you do not obey. Again, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to vvhat he calls the Human Law is, You ſhall not have this or that Man for Prince, or, which is all one, You ſhall not obey him in juſt Commands. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has not yet produc'd any Command of the Divine Law which ſaies this, nor vvill, till Rebellion become a part of Gods Law. In fine, Whoever perſiſts to put a contradiction betwixt Fearing God and Honouring the King, will be Confuted by all the Bells in the Pariſh. Laſtly, Whereas he makes it only by Human Law that this or that Man is King, they Reply, vvhat you have more at large in a former Letter, That He becomes King, as the Pope becomes Pope, by Human means; but when he once is ſo, Obedience to him is by Divine Right, and ſo; if there be any contradiction betwixt Preſerving our Religion and Obeying our Prince, the Divine Law contradicts it ſelf. For as Preſervation of Religion is Divine Law, ſo Obedience to Princes is Divine Law too. If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> be not pleas'd vvith theſe Anſwers they leave him to make better himſelf, retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as they are very good at Reparty, his Argument againſt a ſcandalous Pope; for he, ſay they, expoſes Vertue to evident danger; For ſuch as the Ruler, ſuch will be the Inhabitants. And Gods Law is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd when 'tis contrary to Human Law, and Gods Law obliges us to preſerve Vertue, and 'tis by Human Law only that this or that Man is Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106994:85"/>
                     <p>And ſo we come to another Argument from the parity betwixt an Infidel Prince and an Infidel Husband, whom the Apoſtle allows the Faithful Wife to leave, and therefore, Why are not the Faithful People as free in reſpect of an Infidel Prince? In Anſwer to this they Diſpute ſeveral things with exactneſs enough, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the particular Caſes where, and how far, and why Divorce is lawful, find ſeveral Diſparities, and ſeveral Reaſons why the Argument concludes not. But to leave thoſe Conſiderations, which are not without their perplexity, this Reply of theirs ſeems very plain. Bring, ſay they, a Permiſſion from the Apoſtle for a Subject to deſert his Prince, as plain as this is for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to leave her Husband, and we vvill acknowledge the caſe is equal. The Apoſtle plainly derogates from the general Rule, and brings an Exception wherein the Law of Marriage binds not. He that was ſo careful of Private concerns, cannot be imagined unmindful of Public and greater. Had he known any Exception from the general Rule of Obeying Princes, it is not to be ſuſpected he would conceal it, and teſtifie more care for Private Families than Commonwealths. So that the Argument amounts to this: We are free from the Law in caſes where the Law is diſpenſt with, therefore we are free likewiſe where 'tis not diſpenſt with. Again, ſay they, the Woman is only then free when the Man refuſes to live vvith her, for if he ſtay S. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhes her to ſtay vvith him. Now if any Prince refuſes to Govern his People, unleſs they vvill become Infidels like himſelf, I think they will allow the People are not obliged to turn Infidels for his ſake, but may get them another in caſe he leave them. But if the King will ſtay with his People, ſince the Woman is to ſtay with her Husband who vvill be with her, they think the very parity concludes the People oblig'd to ſtay vvith their Prince. Otherwiſe the parity ſtands in this manner: Even as the Faithful Woman is not to leave her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband who vvill continue vvith her; even ſo, the Believing People are to leave their Unbelieving
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106994:85"/> King who vvill ſtay vvith them. Or, even as the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Woman is free from an Unbelieving Husband who caſts her off, even ſo the Beleiving People are free from an Unbelieving King vvho does not caſt them off. Which methinks are ſomething unlike for Parities.</p>
                     <p>The next Argument is of great eſteem with <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> He made it in his Book <hi>De Rom. Pont.</hi> and repeats it in <hi>Tortus,</hi> and urges it largely againſt <hi>Barklay.</hi> This it is: <hi>Princes are receiv'd into the Church with this either expreſs or tacit bargain, to ſubmit their Scepters to Chriſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and defend their Religion, and this under penalty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting their Kingdoms if they fail. Wherefore, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Heretics, or an obſtacle to Religion, they may without injury be Judged and Depoſed by the Church. For he is not fit to receive the Sacrament of Baptiſm, who is not diſpoſed to ſerve Chriſt, and loſe all he has for his ſake, according to S.</hi> Luke 14. If any one comes to me, and hates not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he cannot be my Diſciple. <hi>And the Church would err too grievouſly if She admitted a King who without Controul would cheriſh Hereſie, and overthrow Religion.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">C. 24.</note> Thus Argues <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in <hi>Rom. Pont.</hi> But againſt <hi>Barklay</hi> more largely. <hi>Let us imagine,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>an Infidel Prince, deſirous to be receiv'd into the Church, ſhould ſpeak in this manner: I deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fellow Citizen with the Saints by Baptiſm, and promiſs to ſubmit my Scepter to Chriſt, and defend his Church to my power, and never to break my holy purpoſe. Nevertheleſs, If I happen to break my Word, and become an Heretic, or Apoſtate, or Pagan, I will not be puniſht with Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, either by the Church, or its Preſident, or any but Chriſt; and if the Chief Governour of the Church ſeparate me from the Communion of the Faithful, I will nevertheleſs that the Faithful Sons of the Church continue Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to me, and may not be abſolved from the bond of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by any. Such a King,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>if</hi> Barklay <hi>think fit for Baptiſm, wiſe men would laugh at him. For if a man ſhould deſire to be incorporated into any City, and ſhould protest that if he had a mind to betray that City, he would not be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:86"/> judged by the Magiſtrates of it, but by the King who dwells far off, every body would laugh at him. And truly He that, according to the Goſpel, ought be prepar'd to loſe his life for the Faith of Chriſt, ought more to be prepared to loſe an Earthly Kingdom. But 'tis ridiculous to ſay, I am ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of my Kingdom, if I renounce my Faith, but not by any Sentence of Man, but will have Sentence pronounct againſt me by the Angels in Heaven. The Church would be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to receive into her boſom a Man who would, without controul, afflict the Members of the Church, and not ſuffer the Faithful to be freed from his Tyranny by any Authority on Earth.</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> more zealouſly than wiſely ſay his Adverſaries. Such fine diſcourſes never vvere, nor are ever likely to be made but by the King of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia.</hi> Kings vvho receive Chriſtianity think not of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties, nor imagine they are to treat with their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Inſtructors vvith thoſe nice Cautions, which they uſe in making Leagues, and Treaties of War and Peace with their fellow Kings. To make Proteſtations, and other proviſions of Security, againſt Chances they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, and none but a man cunning in <hi>Chican</hi> ever would think of, as if Baptiſm were a bargain made in Law, wherein, if by misfortune the Writings be not exactly drawn a man forfeits his Title to his Purchaſe, or a man becomes liable to Eternal damnation for the fault of a Scrivener, is a conceit of a more ſubtle reach than is like to proceed from the ſimplicity with which men deal in the concerns of Eternity. However, if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> do put ſuch thoughts into the head of a Pagan, he may very juſtly proteſt: I deſire to be made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and intend to live like one, and ſubmit to the Diſcipline of that Law which I am going to imbrace: but I mean to keep my Regal dignity and Prorogatives inviolate, and do not intend to be put by Baptiſm into a worſe condition than now I am in. My Subjects are now my Subjects, and I intend they alwaies ſhall be ſo. For my ſelf, if I deſerve it, I refuſe not to be expell'd from that Society of which I ſhall have made my ſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:86"/> unworthy; But as I had my Subjects before Baptiſm, I will not that Baptiſm ſhall take them from me. I am a King while I am no Chriſtian, and if I ceaſe to be a Chriſtian, will not therefore ceaſe to be a King. God, not Baptiſm gave me a Crown, and none but God ſhall take it away. A Pagan, ſay they, may warrantably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thus much, and warrantably even according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, who teaches that the Law of Chriſt deprives no man of any right, and when a King becomes Chriſtian he loſes no Right or Dominion, but gets a new right to the Kingdom of Heaven, for elſe the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſt would be a prejudice to Kings, and Grace deſtroy Nature. As for the Compariſon betwixt him who pretends to the Freedom of a City, and him who pretends to Baptiſm, the Proteſt which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> enters in his behalf is indeed ridiculous, and overthrown by his very pretence; for a Member of a City muſt, by his very being a Member, be ſubject to the Laws and Magiſtrates of that City; And ſo a King, if he become a Member of the Spiritual Commonwealth, becomes ſubject to the Laws, and Magiſtrates, and Puniſhments of that Commonwealth, which are Spiritual, and may be inflicted on a King as well as other men (conſidering their own Natures purely, and abſtracting from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which in the caſe of Kings are generally ſuch, that, if it be lawful, it is ſeldom expedient to uſe them) but for Temporal puniſhments, He is himſelf the Head of that Commonwealth which ſhould inflict them, and muſt either puniſh himſelf, or cannot be puniſht but by God; So that to ſay, by his becoming a Member of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Commonwealth he makes Himſelf liable to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments, is to ſay, in the Caſe of him who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be made a Citizen, That by making himſelf a Member of that Corporation he ſubjects himſelf to the Laws of another.</p>
                     <p>But to leave theſe ſpeculations to them who Write of New <hi>Atlantis</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Pines;</hi> The Argument, ſay they, is doubly faulty, for it aſſumes what is not true,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:87"/> and concludes what does not follow though the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were true. Firſt, they deny any ſuch bargains are made in Baptiſm. There is indeed an expreſs, whether Promiſe, or Purpoſe to Renounce Satan and his Pomps, but of Renouncing the Right of Kings, there is not any expreſſion vvhich ſounds like it; and for ſecret bargains, they are ſo ſecret, if there be any, that they are known to none but <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> They have lain hid for many Ages, and do ſo ſtill, for any credit they give this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. He would infer it out of the diſpoſition which our Saviour, in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> requires in him, who vvill be his Diſciple. And this diſpoſition of preferring his Love and Service before all things, they acknowledge is neceſſary in Baptiſm, and that Man unfit for it, vvho does not firmly purpoſe ſo to do. But the Queſtion is, If the King chance to break his good Purpoſe, is He therefore liable to this particular puniſhment of being Depos'd? This particular Condition muſt enter into the bargain, or nothing will come of it. Otherwiſe our God-fathers and God-mothers have undertaken for all of us, that vve ſhall do all that the greateſt King Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Baptiſm. And we all forfeit the Surety they have given, and break the Promiſe ſolemnly made in our behalf, and ſin daily and grievouſly. Can we therefore without injury be turn'd out of our Eſtates? We muſt be prepar'd as vvell as any King, to lay down our lives for the Faith of Chriſt; if for Fear, or other frailty, we fall even to Idolatry, is it therefore lawful to knock us on the head, or if it vvere, Can the Church or Prieſt, before whom vve made this Promiſe which vve have broken, give Sentence of bloud againſt us? How juſtly ſoever we deſerve to be puniſht, yet this puniſhment is not juſt, becauſe we never ſubmitted to it in Baptiſm, or any other way; and if we did, the Church, of all the vvorld, can the leaſt inflict it. But the truth is, no ſuch puniſhment vvas ever thought of, either by the Givers or Receivers of Baptiſm. If vve do not continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to our Renouncing of Satan, Satan vvill take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:87"/> of us again, to whom the Church may, vvhen there is juſt occaſion, by her Power deliver us. And, if Satan be not puniſhment enough even for a King, and the Wickedeſt King that ever was or will be, I am migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily miſtaken. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> therefore vvas leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than vvould be expected, when he talks every where as if Kings, unleſs they were liable to be Depos'd, would be vvithout puniſhment. Methinks Excommunication might ſerve turn, Excommunication vvhich as himſelf ſaies,<note place="margin">L. 3. de <hi>Laic.</hi> C. 2.</note> is a puniſhment greater than Temporal death. It being more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as himſelf Cites S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Satan by Excommunication, than to endure the Sword, or Fire, or be devoured by Wild Beaſts. <hi>Death</hi> is the laſt of puniſhments with us of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral form, and if a Wicked Prince may be puniſht by the Church with a puniſhment worſe than Death, I know not vvhy the charitable Anger of a Churchman may not be ſatisfied vvith it. However it be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Eccleſ.</hi> C. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Excommunication is the moſt grievous puniſhment which the Church can inflict: when ſhe has proceeded ſo far, She has no more to do,</hi> ſaies <hi>Coeleſtin.</hi> 3. Wherefore if Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a thing with vvhich the Church has nothing to do, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> may be content, if that be not done which cannot be done, and e'en ſubſcribe to <hi>Pet. Gregorius,</hi> teaching as learnedly as honeſtly,<note place="margin">L. 26. de <hi>Repub.</hi> C. 5.</note> that <hi>Rebellion againſt Princes, upon pretence of their Vices, cannot ſcape the Crime of Treaſon and Indignation of God, and thoſe who reign wickedly are rather to be left to the Judgment of God, than the hands of Subjects be polluted with Sacriledge and Parricide. God wants not Means when he pleaſes either to amend, or take away ſuch Bad Princes.</hi> But to return to the Argument, They poſitively deny any bargain at all made in Baptiſm, unleſs you vvill call the Purpoſe they make to live Vertuouſly an expreſs bargain, and a ſubmiſſion to the Law vvhich the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed embrace, and conſequently to the puniſhments of it,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:88"/> an implicit one; as indeed, who is once Baptized, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince or Private man, may upon occaſion be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſht, and Reprehended, and Cenſured by the Church, but if Human frailty, and the Temptations to vvhich our Nature is ſubject, make a Prince break either this Bargain or Purpoſe, that he ſhould therefore be content to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or that he Bargains to ſubmit to any ſuch Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they flatly deny, and ſay, that by the ſame Reaſon, ſince every Private man makes the ſame Bargain in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which any King does, every Man that Sins might preſently without injury Done him, have his Eſtate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, or be ſent to the Galleys or the Gallows: Which would make ſtrange vvork in a World ſo frail as ours. And for this Reaſon they deny the Conſequence, as vvell as the Antecedent of this Argument. For, ſay they, although a Prince ſhould bargain to forfeit or Crown or Life, if he forfeit his Faith, unleſs he bargain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that the Church or Pope be Garranty of this Treaty, and give them power to proceed to Depoſition in caſe of Failer on his part, nothing is done, and they have otherwiſe no power to do it. For all the Power they receiv'd from God is Spiritual, and is not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with matters ſo Temporal. So that a King muſt not only ſubmit to the Churches Power, but create in her a Power vvhich God gave her not, or nothing vvill come of it.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole they ſay two things which ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable enough. Firſt, that this claim from Bargain or Promiſe, whether expreſs or tacit, plainly evinces there is no Internal proper Power in the Church to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes, for then there were no need of this Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right by bargain; beſides, that if ſuch Power accrue to her, as it cannot be other than according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms of the Contract, ſo it vvould not be Indirect, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pretends, but as Direct as can be imagined; there being in the World no Power more Direct than I have over thoſe things for which I have bargain'd. Next, they ſay, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> manifeſtly contradicts
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:88"/> what other Divines, and himſelf vvith them, teach of the Nature of the Promiſe made in Baptiſm. <hi>Suarez</hi> obſerves, that this Promiſe is not to be underſtood a proper Promiſe or Vow made to God, but only an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which the very Profeſſion of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion made in Baptiſm induces, by reaſon of the Divine Law, and Power granted by Chriſt to his Church. Which I take to ſignifie, Whereas in things in vvhich we are otherwiſe free, we can oblige our ſelves by Vow or Promiſe (as vvhen I Vow to give Alms, or do any other good Work) and this Vow induces an Obligation vvhich otherwiſe I had not; but in things vvhere we are otherwiſe obliged, if I Vow to perform them, I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to no more by my Vow than I was before; that the Promiſe made in Baptiſm is of this ſecond ſort, and People were oblig'd to the performance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Law then receiv'd, although they made no promiſe ſo to do.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Monach.</hi> C. 19.</note> So <hi>Bellarmin</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where teaches, <hi>That the promiſe, made in Baptiſm, is nothing but a teſtification, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Obligation, which the Law of God brings with it—Neither are the Baptized bound to any, either Explicite or Implicite intention of obliging themſelves farther, than as they are oblig'd by the Law of God.</hi> And farther, <hi>That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Chriſtians are forced by the Church to keep the Laws of Christ, not ſo much in virtue of their Promiſe, as out of this that they are become Members and Children of the Church, and every Member is ſubject to the Head, and every Child by the Law of Nature to his Parent.</hi> Wherefore manifeſtly, either the Law of God obliges Princes to ſubmit to Depoſition without any bargain of theirs, or this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he talks of leaves them as free as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If the Law obliges them, 'tis to no purpoſe to mention Bargains; if it do not, 'tis to no purpoſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince their Bargain ſignifies nothing, for they bargain no farther than to obſerve the Law. And the Argument amounts to this; They bargain to be Depos'd, becauſe they bargain to obſerve the Law which obliges
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106994:89"/> them to no ſuch thing. Beſides, if we examine a little more narrowly, and ask by what Law of God Princes become liable to Depoſition, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Anſwers 'tis by Bargain, which is not to be liable by the Law of God: And if we ask again vvhere any ſuch Bargain appears, He tells us, 'tis not an Expreſs, but a Tacit Bargain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in the Law of God; which is plainly to prove the Bargain by the Law, and the Law by the Bargain; and, that is ſuch a kind of Argument as, I think they call a Circle, but ſure 'tis none of the beſt, nor needed have been ſo much eſteemed by <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There follows an Argument which you had light upon, and propos'd to me vvith ſo much ſmart Rallery in a former Letter, from the Compariſon of the Chief Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour in the Church to a Shepheard. Which in ſhort is this. <hi>When it was ſaid to S.</hi> Peter <hi>Feed my Sheep, all Power was given him which is neceſſary to a Shepheard in regard of his Flock. But a Shepheard must have Power against Wolves and Rams that they hurt not the Sheep, and Power to provide, as is convenient, for the Sheep themſelves.</hi> Then applying the Notions of all Three by ſimilitude to Princes, as you have formerly obſerved, he concludes <hi>The Pope has Power over them in reſpect of every one.</hi> They Anſwer, there is more wit than ſolidity in this diſcourſe, Similitudes of all other being the worſt Topies, and which affords the weakeſt Arguments, as ſeldom running, in the School Phraſe, of all Four. The Metaphor is generally, and more fitly underſtood, ſo that by <hi>Wolves</hi> are meant <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> by <hi>Rams</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Church, and by <hi>Sheep</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Faithful.</hi> But allowing him to uſe the Similitude as he pleaſes, and apply it after his own faſhion; to talk vvith him in his own language, they obſerve many differences betwixt a figurative and real Wolf, a figurative and real Sheep, and many defects in the Similitude, and Reaſons vvhy the Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not, even keeping vvithin the terms of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. But to conſider the Thing; Here, ſay they, the Church is compar'd to a Flock, as it vvas before to a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106994:89"/> Commonwealth, and may to be a City, or Family, or Ship, or Army, or twenty things more. All theſe ſeveral Compariſons make no difference in the things compared: For, whether you conſider the Pope as Prince of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Commonwealth, or Shepheard of a Spiritual Flock, his Power as Prince is not different from his Power as Shepheard, but the ſame, and if you conſider it according to all the Compariſons, of which it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, 'tis ſtill one and the ſame, and that a Spiritual Power. Wherefore all the Similitudes, that are or can be, will never make it other than it is; and the Pope, whether he be lookt upon as a Prince, or a Shepheard, or a Pilot, or however he be conſidered, can do no more than a Spiritual Prince, and a Spiritual Shepheard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Argues, the Pope is a Shepheard, and a Shepheard may drive away or kill a Wolf, and an Infidel Prince is a Wolf, all this, ſay they, even allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Compariſon, is to be underſtood of Spiritual driving away, and Spiritual killing. But when he infers, Therefore he may Depoſe him, he paſſes from Spirituals to Temporals, and leaves his Allegory and the truth too. The Pope may Admoniſh and Command the Flock not to follow the Wolf in what he is a Wolf, but in what he is not a Wolf, but a Shepheard himſelf, what ever the Pope ſay to the contrary, they are bound to obey the Power which God has ſet over them. It is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law that Subjects obey their Prince, and Princes ceaſe not to be Princes by turning Infidels, nor Subjects to be Subjects by becoming or remaining Faithful: And that all the Similitudes in the World ſhould diſpenſe with the Law of God, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> may talk as long as he will, but they will not believe him.</p>
                     <p>For the reſt theſe kind of Arguments, if too much credit were given to them, would make mad work. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhop, and every Curate is as truly a Shepheard as the Pope. Their Flocks indeed are not ſo large, but they are truly Flocks, and ſuffice to denominate their Governours with propriety Shepheards, If this quality
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106994:90"/> enable him who has it to Depoſe a Prince, there is no remedy but every Biſhop has Power to Depoſe the King who is of his Dioceſs, and every Curate him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to his Pariſh. And ſince Private men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs Title to their Eſtates than the King to his Kingdom, if Kings be ſubject to this Power, Private men are much more; and ſo, becauſe the Argument with a little more ſtretching would reach to every Sin, within a little while every Sinner might be diſpoſſeſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate at the pleaſure of his Biſhop or Curate; which in time would make ſuch work, that People would go near to hate all Arguments, and all Scholars for <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ſake, and as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, Forbid all Learning that they may live in Peace and Security. Beſides, if the fancy ſhould take a man to apply this very Allegory to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for if it were ſaid to S. <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep,</hi> it was of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I ſay to <hi>Cyrus, Thou art my Shepheard. Iſay</hi> 44. and of <hi>David, Thou ſhalt feed my People</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Paral.</hi> 11. and then apply this Notion of the Wolf, and furious Ram, to a wicked ſcandalous Pope, over whom he muſt have Power if he cannot otherwiſe preſerve his own Flock; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> muſt either unravel all he has weav'd here, or Princes will have more Power over Bad Popes than he will think fit to allow them. In the mean time, of the two waies by which he ſaies in <hi>Rom. Pont.</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be prov'd, Reaſons and Examples, Theſe are all he produces of the firſt kind. You will judge of them, while I paſs to the other.</p>
                     <p>He brings in all Twelve, Two in the Old Law, and Ten in the New. Thoſe of the Old are <hi>Ozias</hi> depos'd for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie by <hi>Azarias,</hi> and <hi>Athalia</hi> by <hi>Joiada</hi> for Idolatry. Of theſe two, one was never Depoſed, and the other never a Queen, but by Uſurpation. <hi>Ozias</hi> for his Preſumption was miraculouſly ſtruck with Leproſie, and by the Prieſts according to their duty, and the command of the Law, put out of the Temple, and ſeparated from the People: but, for the reſt, continued King till his dying day, his Son ſupplying his place in what his Diſeaſe permitted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106994:90"/> him not to interpoſe himſelf. <hi>Athalia</hi> endeavoured to ſettle her ſelf in the Kingdom by the Murther of all the Children of <hi>Ochozias,</hi> but was miſtaken. <hi>Joas</hi> was ſaved by his Aunt <hi>Jeboſeth,</hi> and, by the honeſty and credit of her Husband <hi>Joiada,</hi> put in Poſſeſſion of the Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereof the Right had been in him all the while. So that the Argument from this Inſtance ſtands thus. The High Prieſt amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was inſtrumental in placing his true Soveraign in his Throne, therefore the High Prieſt among the Chriſtians may tumble a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign out of his Throne, which for a man of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Vogue is ſomething odly Argued.</p>
                     <p>His Third Example, and Firſt from the New Law, is, the dealing of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> with the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whom, after a Cruelty commanded by him in a tranſport of Anger, he admitted not into the Church, till he had Repented, and make ſatisfaction. I know not, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he makes the moſt unpromiſing entry into his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that may be. In the former Inſtances, one had no Depoſition, the other, no Lawful Prince to be Depos'd, and in this there is neither Depoſition, nor Pope to make it. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> not of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I hope he will not extend this Depoſing Power to every Biſhop. However, what he did, not only every Biſhop, but every Ghoſtly Father, may do both lawfully and laudably. It is the Office of Churchmen to induce Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repentance if they can, and perſwade them to thoſe Remedies which may hinder them from relapſing into the ſame faults; And they have here the Zeal of an excellent Prelate, ſucceſsful with an excellent Emperour, for their encouragement; and this is all I can perceive in this paſſage. The Fourth is a Priviledge of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great to a certain Monaſtery in which there is this Clauſe; <hi>If any King, Biſhop, Judge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>violate this Decree, of what Dignity or Degree ſoever he be, let him be depriv'd of his Honour.</hi> This they take to be a form of Imprecation, not a Legal Decree, as when he ſaies a little after, <hi>And let him be damn'd in the lower Hell with</hi> Judas <hi>the Traytour,</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106994:91"/> &amp;c. or as the ſtile of <hi>Bulls</hi> now is, <hi>Let him know he ſhall incur the Indignation of God,</hi> &amp;c. For they think, that for the Pope directly to command People ſhould be damn'd, is not very commendable in him, nor very wiſe in any who ſhould think he does ſo. Wherefore to look upon theſe kind of expreſſions as other than Threats, by which men may be frighted from Wickedneſs, they conceive is both againſt S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Sence, and Common Sence too. The next is the Example of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Tribute to be paid to <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Iconoclaſt;</hi> and this is one of thoſe Stories which <hi>Onuphrius</hi> reckons amongſt Fables, and <hi>Platina</hi> expreſly denies, for he ſaies the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were ſo exaſperated againſt the Emperour, that the Pope was feign to interpoſe his Authority to keep them from chooſing another Emperour. So that till the matter of Fact be agreed, 'tis an uncomfortable and uſeleſs Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to buſie our ſelves with thinking what will follow out of it. There follows the Depoſition of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> by Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> with vvhich they make quick work, and poſitively deny it; not that the King was Depos'd, but that he was Depos'd by the Pope. The <hi>French</hi> indeed conſulted him (as they might have done any other, whoſe Credit they had thought uſeful to their purpoſe) vvhether were more truly King, He who managed all the Affairs of the Kingdom, or he who had the bare Title, but medled with nothing: And He anſwered the former. And this was all he did, for the reſt, what was done, was done by the <hi>French</hi> themſelves. Not but that 'tis likely, he underſtood well enough the meaning of the Queſtion, and was inclin'd to favour <hi>Pepin</hi> all he could, but he did no more; and thoſe who did, have long ſince given account to God of their action. I know not of what humour the <hi>French</hi> were in thoſe times, but he that ſhould at this day maintain in <hi>France,</hi> The Pope has Power to Depoſe their King, would go neer to be confuted with a Halter. The Seventh and Eighth Examples are, The Tranſlation of the Empire to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and ſetling the Electours who are to chooſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106994:91"/> the Emperour. This is a Queſtion of vvhich <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has written Three entire Books, and is of more both importance and labour than to be treated with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in a Letter. That which <hi>Withrington</hi> Anſwers is in ſhort, That the Pope concurred to the Tranſlation of the Empire, and Nomination of the Electours, not as acting by his own ſole Power, but as one who, for the place he held, had much, and perhaps more Intereſt in the buſineſs than any other. To which purpoſe he Cites <hi>Mich. Coccinius,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>The People of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the reſt of the Nations of</hi> Italy <hi>oppreſt by barbarous People, and not only not protected by the</hi> Grecians, <hi>but ill uſed too, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by their Avarice and Imperious humour, transfer'd the Empire from the</hi> Grecians <hi>to the</hi> Germans <hi>in the perſon of</hi> Charles <hi>the Great. And 'tis not to be doubted,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that this Tranſlation was made, and had its force and efficacy from the Conſent and Authority of the People of</hi> Rome <hi>and the reſt of</hi> Italy. <hi>And whereas</hi> Innocent <hi>the Third Writes to</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toldus, <hi>That the Apostolic See transfer'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire from the</hi> Grecians <hi>to the</hi> Germans; <hi>We do not grant the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic See transfer'd it otherwiſe, than by Conſenting to thoſe who did, or by declaring it ought be transfer'd, but the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation had its force and ſtrength from the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> To which purpoſe he alledges alſo Card. <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> ſpeaking in this manner: <hi>Whence the Electours ordain'd in the time of</hi> Henry <hi>the Second by common Conſent of all</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>and Others ſubject to the Empire, have their Radical Power from this common Conſent of all, who by the Law of Nature could chooſe themſelves an Emperour not from the Pope, in whoſe Power it is not to give a King or Emperour to any Country in the World, without its Conſent. But to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the Conſent of</hi> Greg. <hi>the Fifth as of the ſingle Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>who for the Degree in which he is, has an intereſt in Conſenting to the Common Emperour. And rightly; as in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels His Authority concurs in the firſt place by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all the reſt who make the Councel; the force neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the Definition depends, not on the firſt of all Biſhops, but on the common conſent of all, both of him and the reſt.</hi> This is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106994:92"/> what they ſay, How far it is to be allow'd is another Queſtion. The Origin of Empires, and Rights of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are things I have more diſpoſition to admire and reverence, then Diſpute. In the mean time here are Eight of his Twelve Examples, which you ſee are all Conteſted, how rationally you will judge. Thoſe which follow are of <hi>Gegory</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> who Depoſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry,</hi> and Three Popes more who followed his Example; to which he might have added ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being acknowledged that after <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> had once begun, many have imitated him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all claim'd a Power to do ſo. But as He was the firſt unqueſtionable Author of that till then unknown Fact, ſo they maintain, that Fact was unjuſt in him, and not allowable in any of his Succeſſours. They Anſwer then firſt with <hi>Jo. Paris. That Arguments are not to be drawn from ſuch ſingular Facts, which proceed ſometimes from Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church, or from ſome other Cauſe, and not from Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Law:</hi> And with <hi>Greg. Tholoſ. From hence I gather only, that 'tis a difficult Queſtion, Whether Popes can Depoſe Emperours or Kings, who formerly had Power to make Popes? Beſides, there are found divers Depoſitions of Popes by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as well as of Emperours by Popes, ſo that there has been a great Viciſſitude in theſe things. Whence 'tis a bad way of Diſputing to argue from Fact, and the Examples of Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. — Out of all which, Ambitious diſturbers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of Kingdoms, and Rebels to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Princes may gather firſt, That every Depoſition of Princes is not therefore Juſt, becauſe it has been done, for all Facts are not Just; and ſecondly, That no ſuch Conſequence ought to be made, there is an Example of ſuch a thing, therefore the like may be attempted again.</hi> And in the words of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, <hi>De</hi> Rom. <hi>Pont. L</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 29. ſpeaking to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which Popes have been Depos'd by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. <hi>Such things,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>have been done, but how juſtly let them look to it. — 'Tis plain that</hi> Otho <hi>the Firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi> John <hi>the Twelfth with a good Zeal, though not according to knowledge, for this</hi> John <hi>was one of the worſt Popes that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106994:92"/> ever was. And therefore no wonder if a Pious Emperour, as this</hi> Otho <hi>was, but not ſo skillful in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he might be Depos'd, eſpecially ſince many Doctors thought ſo as well as he. For 'tis one thing,</hi> ſaies he in <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, to bring Examples of Kings</hi> (ſaies he, of Popes, ſay they) <hi>and another to prove their Power and Authority.</hi> Secondly, They Anſwer, that if it be a good Proof that a thing may lawfully be done, which has been done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Wickedeſt things in the world may be prov'd Lawful. People may lawfully Rebel, Public and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Faith may be broken, Commonwealths may be overturn'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all theſe things have been done. And without more adoe Popes may be Depos'd by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, as well as they by Popes, for that has been done too. Laſtly, and with a little more ſmartneſs, They ſay this way of Proof plainly begs the Queſtion, and aſſumes the very Point in Diſpute. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms, and his Adverſaries deny, the Pope may juſtly Depoſe Princes; now to Argue, <hi>He has Depos'd them therefore He juſtly may,</hi> aſſumes, That what he has done is Juſt, which is the very Point they Conteſt with him; and therefore think it had been ſomething ſhorter, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as much to purpoſe, to have ſaid, <hi>'Tis Juſt becauſe 'tis Just.</hi> Every body knows Popes have both challenged and uſed a Depoſing Power, but every body is not ſatisfied that this Power is juſtly due to him. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> undertakes to prove it is, and brings for an Argument, That he has us'd it, which no body denies, and would have that conclude, That therefore he juſtly may, which if his Adverſaries had thought a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they had not put him to the trouble of making it. For they knew and acknowledged the Antecedent enough before. But they think the Popes did amiſs who did ſo, and if barely ſaying that they did the thing, be proving they had right to do it, they confeſs they are in the wrong; but if it be not, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is ſo, and ſhould have conſidered that barely to ſay his Tenet over is a kind of Proof which takes with none but very good natur'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106994:93"/> People, and as far as I ſee his Adverſaries are a little more ſtubborn.</p>
                     <p>I am ſo weary with long Writing, that I muſt intreat your permiſſion to refer what remains to another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. I will hope I have ſaid enough to quiet your ſuſpicions, and am ſure I have ſaid ſo much that I need ſome quiet my ſelf, and muſt take leave, after ſo long a Journey, to reſt a while.</p>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion indeed is the ſtrongeſt Principle of action, but not the only one. It is no part of Religion that two and three make five; but yet if you do think to pay a debt of five pounds, with twice forty ſhillings, no body will deal with you. And if all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> adhere to theſe Doctrines, whether this adheſion of theirs proceed from Religion, or any other motion, the men will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe and irreconcileable to the ſecurity of their Country, let the Religion be what it will. But if there be any who think them falſe, it were convenient both for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:95"/> of their Prince and Fellow ſubjects, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the thinkers, People ſhould know who thoſe <hi>any</hi> are. We cannot know your thoughts unleſs you acquaint us with them. And becauſe we have reaſon to believe, that ſome do hold them, and no reaſon to believe of any particular man; but he is of the number till he diſclaim them, what can we do but involve you all, guilty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if there be any ſuch, in the ſame condemnation of diffidence.</p>
                     <p>You tell me the <hi>French</hi> plainly and openly condemn them: The honeſter men they; and the more ſhame for ſome body that there ſhould be more honeſty found in <hi>France</hi> then <hi>England.</hi> You ſhould do as they do though t'were but to be in the mode. In all their airy toys, their Feathers, their Perukes, their Pantaloons you can follow them faſt enough. But when they play the men, and ſet you examples of praiſ-worthy actions, there you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be out of faſhion; as if it were an honor to be as light as they, and a ſhame to be as wiſe. But pray what ſecurity is it to <hi>England,</hi> that they are good ſubjects in <hi>France?</hi> If they were knaves all over the reſt of the world, and we all honeſt at home, it were a great deal better for us than that they ſhould be honeſt abroad, and we knaves at home. I perceive indeed by what they do, that you tell me true when you ſay theſe Tenets are no points of your Faith: But then methinks you ſhould have the leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to diſclaim them. Unleſs perhaps you think them true; which if you do, either make them out to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with goverment, or you will not be conſiſtent your ſelf. I tell you plainly I ſhall think ill of you, if you think well of theſe Doctr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In other Countrys you tell me; They are more reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and will not ſay <hi>you can not,</hi> but <hi>you ſhall not.</hi> And I believe you have liv'd in thoſe other Countrys, and ſuck't
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:95"/> their Polities with their Air. But for my part I muſt confeſs I am for the mode once in my life, and would be of the <hi>French</hi> faſhion in this particular. 'Tis true as long as there is good intelligence betwixt Prince and ſubject, and the Peoples affections carry them to their Soveraigns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, this <hi>ſhall not</hi> may do pretty well. For no effect can follow from a Power which is hindred to work, and 'twill be alwayes eaſy enough to find a pretence for not doing what we are before hand reſolved ſhall not be done. Neither did I ever think the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power ſo ſtong, that it was likely to prevail where Prince and People both joyn againſt it So that in this caſe your <hi>Can not</hi> and your <hi>Shall not</hi> are two lines which meet both in the ſame center, <hi>no depoſition.</hi> But what becomes of a King, if his ſubjects be not affected as they ſhould? A mule is not more humerous than the Multitude, nor can boggle more extravagantly, and upon leſs occaſion. And though they be well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are ſubject to be wrought upon by the artifice of thoſe who are not, and eaſily poſſeſt with a thouſand jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and fears, from which even thoſe who poſſeſs them perhaps are free enough themſelves. If upon any capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious toy of their own, or crafty ſuggeſtion from abroad they come to wiſh the Prince leſs Power then he has, and that he ſtood in awe of ſome body, 'twill be the eaſieſt thing in the World to perſwade them that what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould be true, is ſo, and that he is ſubiected to the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe claim is as fair as any, if they would have him ſubject at all. And where's your <hi>Shall not</hi> then? I fear he will go near to repent the modeſty of his Polities, and find too late that by delaying to fix the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Can not</hi> in the minds of his ſubjects, he has brought a worſe <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> upon himſelf, a <hi>Can not</hi> avoy'd being turn'd out of his Throne. If in ſuch a poſture of things he would but go about to perſwade the People of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Can not</hi> on all likelyhood t'would incenſe them more, and make them think it yet more juſt he ſhould be deprived of his own right, who would invade the right of another For if it be not truly the <hi>Pope</hi>'s right, why did he ſuffer it to paſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:96"/> uncontroul'd ſo long, and now begin to queſtion it when it makes againſt him? But let them do what they will in other Countries, and follow ſuch Maxims as they conceive fitteſt for them. Plain dealing ſuits beſt with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natures, and will I believe prove the beſt Policy. If they think good elſewhere to let their ſecurity depend on tricks, much good may their Policies do them: I ſhould be ſorry it ſhould be taken for good Policy here.

Afterwards <hi>Barclay</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Withrington</hi> in <hi>England</hi> write both againſt him. And as oppoſition is the beſt whetſtone of wit, the ſight of what can be ſaid againſt us on the one ſide enlarging won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully our proſpect of things, and repreſenting them in a clearer view, and on the other, the ſhame of being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and pleaſure of victory ſtreining our abilities, and preſſing from them all they will afford. We cannot but look upon theſe later productions of his as the uttermoſt he was able to do. For certainly, he omitted nothing which he thought could be ſaid in his defence.

Since Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> time what is once new in the Church is alwaies new. For 'tis not with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as with faſhions. A new doctrine can never grow old, nor an old doctrine new. To fix antiquity on what was not heard of in the Church for ten ages, is with the confidenteſt, and he muſt truſt much to his Rhetorick, who goes about to perſwade it. In the mean time <hi>John Barclay,</hi> in defence of his Father, has reaſon to ſay that this leaving the common conſent is not to be objected to him; but to thoſe who ſpring up in later ages, teach againſt the torrent of the Ancient Church.</p>
                     <p>But to his Argument. Of the 70 Authors which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces out of <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Germany</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> and all ſince <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. with whom he begins, a great part are <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> many ſuch Divines who go their way, and only uſe their Arguments; ſome are not for him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers plainly againſt him. At leaſt <hi>John Barclay</hi> ſays ſo, who examines them all particularly. For my part I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to take ſo much pains. To read threeſcore and ten depoſitions and ſift them one by one, is beyond my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. A man would ſooner looſe an ordinary cauſe then carry it at the expence of ſo much toyl. But if I miſtake not, ſatisfaction may be had at a cheaper rate. The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick is Autority, and that to my apprehenſion is efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but in two caſes. One, vvhen the point in queſtion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106994:97"/> the reach of reaſon, as in Myſteries of Faith, which becauſe the ſhortneſs of human underſtanding cannot comprehend, there is no means for men to lay hold of but by relying on ſuch an underſtanding as can and does. Thus Religion is believ'd, becauſe much of it cannot be ſeen, and our ſecurity is the Authority of our firſt Teacher God and Man, who we are ſure ſaw himſelf what we could not, and brought good evidence that he did ſo. And ſo upon the matter we ſee with his eyes what we cannot with our own. The other caſe which requires Authority is from a contrary ground, not from the abſtruſeneſs of the points propos'd, but weakneſs of the underſtanding to which they are propoſed. As when I preſs ſomething upon another, whereof I could bring proof good enough, but his dulneſs cannot take it. Here again Authority is all the Argument which can be uſed. If I have not credit enough to perſwade him to believe me, there is nothing to be done. You may ſay, if you will, there is the ſame reaſon in both caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Weakneſs of Underſtanding; only in the firſt, the weakneſs is general, and extends to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; in the ſecond particular, and belongs but to ſome. But which ſoever you ſay, I do not remember that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is otherwiſe concluſive. Wherefore this point of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power muſt either be of a Nature too ſublime for any underſtanding to reach, or it cannot be preſt by Authority but only upon the weak and dull. I know not which of the two <hi>Bellarmin</hi> fancied, when he choſe this Argument, but in my opinion they are wild fancies both. If he thought it ſo ſublime, how came he by it himſelf? And to what purpoſe does he bring ſo many reaſons to prove what is above reaſon, and not attainable by it? There is no way to climb to ſuch a height but by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſteps of one to another, whereof the firſt had it with the reſt of the Myſteries of Religion, from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But as this way is neither endeavoured nor preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo it would place the point in the ſame degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, with the belief of the Trinity, Incarnation, and the reſt; which, to omit the known untruth and what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:98"/> elſe might be ſaid, would leave no excuſe for communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with thoſe who openly diſavow it. Then to think all men weak and dull, and none able to look upon the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling luſtre of thoſe reaſons by which the point may be prov'd, and upon that account deſcend to Authority, is as much on the bow hand on the other ſide, and a fancy which ſeems hardly credible in ſo modeſt a man as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was. And yet one of the two muſt be ſayd, or I know not what place there is for Authority. Of a thing which can it ſelf be ſeen, and to thoſe who can ſee it, it ſeems to as little purpoſe to talk what others ſay of it, as if, to perſwade men that this ribond is green, and the other blew, I ſhould ſpend time in numbring how many thought ſo, when 'tis but ſhewing the ribonds and every body can tell what their color is.</p>
                     <p>To my apprehenſion therefore the whole Topic ſeems improper and ill choſen. Notwithſtanding let us ſee what it will do. And in the firſt place methinks it were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to take along with us what Authority means, and how they ought be qualified who can pretend to it. And becauſe I intend not to make a common place of it, and ſwell my Letter by delating farther then is neceſſary, I ſhall mention but one qualification; but ſuch an one as in my opinion is very requiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority others are to be perſwaded, do themſelves know that to which others are to be perſwaded. For I obſerve the world is a little reſty and unwilling to be led by thoſe whom they account weak and ſhallow. And then this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is an Argument, which does not render the truth apparent to the eyes of thoſe who accept it upon Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſuppoſe it ſeen by Authority, and in vertue of that ſight to be believed by other folks. But if it be not ſeen by thoſe whoſe Authority is preſt upon me, I can not imagine what title they can pretend to Authority, nor in vertue of what I can be preſt to follow it. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if I be blind my ſelf it is very unreaſonable I ſhould take for a guide one who is as blind as I am. When one blind man leads another, we know what becomes of both.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106994:98"/> Now becauſe a concluſion is not ſeen till it be rightly prov'd, among thoſe ſeventy men of Authority whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alleadges, there muſt be ſome one or more, who has ſeverely prov'd the point in queſtion, or neither he nor any man elſe can ſay that any of them ſaw it. If there be no full proof among them all, there can be no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor reaſon why others ſhould take them for Guides, who for any thing we know are themſelves blind, as well as thoſe whom they would lead. If there be, ſhew the ribond without more ado, and never amuſe us with what other people ſay of the colour. It is a much ſhorter and much eaſier way for him to produce, and us to ſee one good proof, then to ſtand ſifting the depoſitions of 70 men whereof 69 perhaps ſpeak little to the purpoſe. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all too, this proof muſt needs appear at laſt; for till it do, as I come from ſaying, there is no reaſon we ſhould believe thoſe who, for ought appears, know no more than we who are required to believe them.</p>
                     <p>But to make this matter as plain as I can, what is the reaſon, when a man affirms a thing without proof, there is ſo little obligation, that on the contrary tis lightneſs to believe him? I ſuppoſe, becauſe bringing no proof (and by no proof I mean no ſufficient proof) he may for ought appears be miſtaken, and we with him. Why then inſtead of one put twenty that ſay it, or if you will a hundred, or as many as Arithmetick can number; and put them to bring no more proof then the ſingle man, in what is their caſe different from his, or how am I excus'd from lightneſs or ſecur'd from error if I believe them? Wherefore, either produce the man who brings ſufficient proof, and let us ſee that ſufficient proof of his, and let alone the 69 Cyphers which ſtand before him; or if none can be produced, 'tis a clear caſe they are altogether ſo many inſufficient proofs, and to think that number is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, when every particular is inſufficient, is to think that a great many nothings vvill make ſomething.</p>
                     <p>And this is the caſe of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Authority, which yet has ſomething particular in it. Of his 70 Witneſſes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:99"/> half are either Canoniſts, or ſuch who profeſſing other ſtudies, rely in this point on the Arguments of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts. Theſe Arguments <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf thinks faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and has taken ſucceſsful pains to confute. Now would I fain know what great neceſſity there is of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe, who I know before hand have themſelves no reaſon to believe what they tell me? To offer me theſe, is plainly to offer me error for ſecurity againſt error, and to make me believe that I ſhall not be deceiv'd if I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe who are, and that the way to go right is to go after thoſe who ſtray. I know <hi>Bellarmin</hi> thinks them right in the main though they miſtake in a circumſtance; for example, that they think well of the power, though they are out in thinking it <hi>Direct.</hi> But if they miſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all in the circumſtance, how can I know but they do ſo in the main? 'Tis plain they all miſtake when they ſay 'tis <hi>direct;</hi> therefore their conſent in ſaying a thing, does not make that thing to be true; wherefore neither can the other, in which he thinks they ſay true, be therefore true; becauſe they ſay it, and this even in <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that he ſhould preſs that on another which he does not value himſelf, ſeems a little unreaſonable. Then for the other half who go upon other grounds then the Canoniſts, I will take the liberty to ſuppoſe they go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or worſe. For he was too ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious a man, to back good arguments, and chooſe bad in their rooms. Now what his are, (beſides what you will find here) you know by my laſt. If any man think them good, he may for me. But this is clear, that no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men perſwaded by theſe arguments can add more ſtrength to the concluſion then thoſe arguments give it. And ſo we are juſt where we were. If the Arguments be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove the concluſion, the buſineſs is done, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſuperfluous; if they be not, what he calls Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is but a number of inſufficient proofs, or of men led by them, which infufficiently proofs I am deſired to take for ſufficient proof. And this in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is to deſire me, becauſe thoſe who are deceived are a great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:99"/> many, to believe they are not deceived; as if by adding black to black and laying on black enough the wall would become white. I know that number generally carries with it a fair perſwaſion (eſpecially where the men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe conſiderable) that they are not all miſtaken. But of the one half of theſe, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> aſſures us they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are miſtaken, notwithſtanding their number; and whoever does not approve <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Arguments can not but think as much of the other half. Wherefore it muſt of neceſſity reſt upon proof at laſt, and this Topic of Authority might, in my opinion, have very well been ſpared. For if any can ſee the concluſion prov'd, he needs no Authority, but is oblig'd in vertue of that ſight to ſtand to what he ſees, though there were none in the world of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſame judgment with him. But to thoſe who cannot, this Authority is a bare ſaying without proof, that is no Authority.</p>
                     <p>However <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tryes to make it up, and intitle the Church it ſelf to the ſayings of his 70 men. <hi>What Doctors teach,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>with a common conſent in different times and places, that the univerſal Church is believed to hold and teach. For God therefore placed Paſtors and Doctors in the Church.</hi> Eph. 4. <hi>that the People ſhould follow them as their Guides,</hi> &amp;c. I think, to make this Argument look any thing like, to his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> he ſhould have added <hi>univerſal</hi> conſent. For if Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors teach differently, many one way, and many the quite contrary, I hope the Church ought not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hold and teach what both teach; or if ſhe do, ſhe muſt plainly be believed to hold and teach contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Now for <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s 70 <hi>Canon</hi> hath alledged more then twice 70 on the other ſide. How then is it poſſible to find the Churches doctrine by the conſent of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, when they are ſo far from common conſent that they teach direct contraries? Again, to univerſality of conſent there goes univerſality both of time and place. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> either thought of no more, or could produce no more than out of the Weſtern Church. I hope he does not think the Church confin'd to the Weſt. In all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:100"/> controverſies of Faith, others and he himſelf uſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce teſtimonies from other places. We hear of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> S. <hi>Jo. Chryſoſtom, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. whereof none belong to the Weſt. Can that conſent be univerſal to which there concur none of theſe once ſo famous parts of the Church? Then for time he begins with <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. and he liv'd but in the 11th. age. Are 10 whole ages ſo inconſiderable, that they make nothing to univerſal conſent? Theſe links can never hang well together that have ſuch a gap in them, nor is it poſſible to be believed the Church ſhould univerſally teach what none of all her Doctors in ten ages mentioned. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! how little ſubſtance there is in theſe great words <hi>common conſent</hi> and <hi>the Church:</hi> But <hi>God therefore placed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors that People ſhould follow them,</hi> very true. But when God placed thoſe Paſtors and Doctors, he put into their mouths the Doctrine which they ſhould preach and teach. So far as they deliver that doctrine, they have his Authority for their warrant, but no further. If they will teach any other truth, they may without doubt, provided they can make it appear to be Truth; in which caſe the evidence by which they can make it appear is their warrant, not the Authority of God; and provided far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that what they teach in this manner be neither preſt by them, or accepted by others as part of the Doctrine which they are commiſſionated by Chriſt to teach, but as found out by their own or other mens whether induſtry or luck. For theſe Paſtors and Doctors ceaſe not to be men by becoming Paſtors and Doctors, and men cannot be hindred from doing like men, and uſing their reaſon, and diſcourſing as well as others, and now and then as ill. In which caſes, though the material men be Paſtors and Doctors, yet now they act not as Paſtors and Doctors, but barely as men. Daily converſation furniſhes us with a hundred examples of the like nature. A Judg for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is a Judg as long as his Commiſſion laſts; but how few of the mans actions belong to the Judg? He governs his Children as a Father, his Servants as a Maſter, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:100"/> diſcourſes as a Scholar, he eats and drinks and ſleeps as a meer man. 'Tis the Judg who does all theſe things. But certainly if he have a bad palate, for example, and chuſe unwholeſom food for ſophiſticated wine, none will think he makes that choice in vertue of his Commiſſion, or that the Prince or State are concern'd in the errors of his Palate. So 'tis with Paſtors and Doctors. In what they act by vertue of the Commiſſion given them by Chriſt, ſo far they are Paſtors and Doctors, in other things meer men; which men are indeed Paſtors and Doctors; but extend not that Authority to things not included in their Commiſſion. When they tell us this Doctrine we have receiv'd from our Predeceſſors, and they from Chriſt, and tell us this with an univerſality of conſent both for time and place, we muſt hear and obey Chriſt in them whoſe commiſſion they execute. But when they diſcourſe, lay down their aſſertions, and bring their proofs, by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s favor, we have no more obligation to be led by them then the ſtrength of their proof layes upon us. For now they are no more Paſtors and Doctors, then the Judg is a Judg when he tells a ſtory, or delivers his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in a point of Law by way of diſcourſe, and without giving ſentence. For my part, I conceive the Church ſo far from being engaged by the opinion of 70 men, though they be all Paſtors and Doctors, that I believe it very poſſible, that all the material Paſtors and all the Doctors in the Church, and all the Sheep and Scholars too, may be perſwaded of a thing which the Church taken as a Church, neither believes, nor has any thing to do with. And I think that ſuch a caſe not only poſſibly may be, but actually has happened; as in the belief of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> the <hi>motion of the earth,</hi> and perhaps twenty ſuch things even at this preſent. The truth is, if any one ſhould put me to it, I do not well know how to prove it. But let us for once ſuppoſe, there was a time when there was no man in the Church more knowing than S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and that the conſent againſt the <hi>Antipodes</hi> was ſo common and univerſal, that there was not ſo much as any one who held otherwiſe. I conceive it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:101"/> would be a very falſe inference, if any ſhould from thence conclude that the Church at that time held there were no <hi>Antipodes.</hi> For 'tis a plain caſe that <hi>Church</hi> imports <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> a derivation from Chriſt; and ſince 'tis known that he taught nothing of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> 'tis clear that no opinion concerning them can belong to Faith, or the Church. Whoever they be who hold for or againſt them, or however they may belong to the Church in other reſpects, in this particular ſhe has nothing to do with him, nor they with her. For now they act not as believers, but as Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and 'tis only as believers that they belong to the Church, for the Chuch is a Congregation of faithful. Tis true theſe believers are many of them Schollars too, but when they play the Scholars have no priviledg, nor ſecurity againſt error from Chriſt or the Church, but muſt look to their diſcourſes, and ſtick to their Learning; in which if they fail, as they very well may and often do, 'tis at their own perils, for the Church is no farther engaged than in what they take from her, and ſhe warrants to be received from Chriſt. But this point is already diſcourſt at large in my firſt letter, and the little I have ſaid here peradventure is more then needs. For this Authority, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would pin upon the Church, is no more then the ſayings of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, whereof one half he recites and diſproves himſelf, the other half depend upon the ſtrength of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the only means by which other men can judg whether they deſerve more credit then their fellows, and when all is done are contradicted by twice as many as learned and as famous. And this I ſhould think ſo far from the Authority of the Church, that 'tis well if it be any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all. And ſo much for the firſt Argument.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is this. <hi>We prove it ſecondly by the Extrav. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſanctam de Major. &amp; Obed. Where we are taught, the ſword is under the ſword, and temporal authority ſubject to the ſpiritual power, and that if the earthly power deviate, it ſhall be judged by the ſpiritual, an inferor ſpiritual, by a ſuperior; and the ſupream ſpiritual only by God. Neither does it make againſt this, that the definition of this Decretal ſeems revok'd by Clemen. 5. in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trav.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:101"/> Meruit. de Privileg. For Clement did not revoke the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant of Boniface, but informed us that it defined no new thing, but declared the ancient obligation, which men have to obey and be ſubject to the Apoſtolick Sea.</hi> Now I ſhould think whether one <hi>Pope</hi> made a Decree, and another did not revoke it, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much, unleſs this Decree determine the point in queſtion. And 'tis a clear caſe, there is not a word of <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in this extravagant of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8, neither has <hi>Bellarmin</hi> remembred to tell us how 'tis implyed, which yet ſeems a material circumſtance. That which he ſays we are taught by it, is that temporal authority is ſubject to ſpiritual power, &amp; may be judged by it if it do amiſs, but the ſupream ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power by none but God. All this may be very true, and the Doctrine of <hi>depoſition</hi> very falſe. When the temporal Sword is drawn by paſſion and ſtrikes with in juſtice, as, to inſtance in an example us'd by himſelf, when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a number of innocent people to be ſlain at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> a leſs man than the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſpiritual power enough to judg and puniſh this temporal power, or in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſhut the Church doors, and not admit the <hi>Emperor</hi> to a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Chriſtian duties, till he had done what became a good Chriſtian, repented and made ſatisfaction. Here the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sword was under the ſpiritual Sword, judg'd and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht by it, and all this while no depoſition nor thought of any ſuch thing. Of all who had their ſhare in that buſineſs, none was better ſatisfi'd then the guilty and puniſht <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> himſelf, who more lov'd and honour'd S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ever after. And 'tis likely if all ſpiritual Princes would imitate the zeal of that excellent Prelate, and preſerving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the dignity of ſecular powers, ſtrive only to redreſs the errors of their frailty, that Temporal Princes would imitate the Piety of that excellent <hi>Emperor,</hi> and there would be never any claſhing betwixt them. But this by the by. I have only to do with the Argument, and 'tis not the leaſt I have to do to find the force of it. For 'tis plain the bare words themſelves, without a comment will not do, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has here forgotten to give a comment. And ſo there remains nothing but to rove at random; and hope, if luck ſerve, to hit right. If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> underſtand this Decree
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:102"/> in that manner in which he underſtood it who made it, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the 8, as far as can be gathered by thoſe who writ of him, was perſwaded he was veſted in a Power as unlimited and abſolute as the wildeſt of Canoniſts ever fancied, that he was the only univerſal Monarch, and all Princes his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without more ado. You remember how he writes to the King of <hi>France: We would have you know, you are ſubject to us both in ſpirituals and temporals, and take for Hereticks who think otherwiſe.</hi> Now there is one, in my opinion, very good reaſon why <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould not underſtand the Decree in this manner, and that is becauſe he thinks that ſence not true, and maintains the <hi>Pope</hi> has no ſuch power, and the Canoniſts are out who give it him. If he will underſtand it as <hi>Clement</hi> 5 ſeems to underſtand it (you muſt pardon me if I entertein you with <hi>ſeemings,</hi> we muſt rove where we can do no better) it will amount to no more than bare ſpiritual power, as indeed the words themſelves carry no farther. <hi>We neither will nor intend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that any prejudice be done to the King or Kingdom of France</hi> by the Decree in queſtion, <hi>nor that the King, Kingdom, or Inhabitants be more ſubject to the Church of Rome then they were formerly, but that all things be in the ſame ſtate in which they were before the ſaid definition.</hi> Now one point of the ſtate in which things were before, was, if we believe the King of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo <hi>Innocent</hi> 3, who had declared as much, that he was ſubject in temporals to no man. And ſo there remains only ſubjection in ſpirituals, in which <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 5 underſtood the Decree, and challenged to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this will freely be allow'd to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> by a great many who for all that will allow no depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now becauſe neither of theſe Comments will fit him, as far as I perceive he will hardly find one ready made, but muſt take the pains to make one for himſelf, if he will do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing And yet when he has done, a Comment is one thing and a Text another. One is not altogether ſo current mony as the other. Although in this particular his comment muſt be better mettal then the Text it ſelf, or will hardly paſs. The whole Canon Law, the Decrees not only of particular <hi>Popes,</hi> but particular Councils, unleſs in circumſtances which happen not in this caſe, are freely and openly deny'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:102"/> the power to oblige to belief. But I will not meddle with this point, which would draw on a new, and that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial diſpute, and I am no man of Controverſy. What I have ſayd is anſwer enough to an Argument no better preſt. Yet I ſhall make one obſervation more, and ſo take leave of it.</p>
                     <p>This Canon according to the declaration of <hi>Clement</hi> 5 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined nothing new, ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> but only declared the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient obligation of being ſubject to the Apoſtolick Sea. Now would I fain underſtand how we ſhould know by this Canon what that ancient obligation was. The queſtion is whether the ancient ſubjection were in temporals or ſpirituals. And the Canon is declared to define neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only the ancient obligation; (and if it define no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the queſtion, it might very well have been let alone) of neceſſity we muſt know what this ancient obligation is, before we can know what this Canon has defined; and then 'tis a clear caſe we can know nothing by the Canon, but muſt depend on another knowledg, and by that find out what the Canon ſayes. If things be left by this Canon, as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſays they are, in the ſtate in which they were before, it is not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible to know how this Canon left them, but by knowing how they were before. See now how well this Canon proves in the <hi>Pope</hi> a power over temporals, which ſays no more but that he has a power he alwaies had, but whether that power be temporal or ſpiritual is wholly ſilent. 'Tis ſomething a new way of arguing, to bring us in proof, that things are as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays they are, a Canon which ſays only they are as they were before, and force us to a new ſearch to know how they were before, of which we have no intelligence from his Canon; but as far as we can have intelligence otherwiſe, have reaſon to think they were quite contrary to what <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> pretends. For the <hi>French,</hi> who took themſelves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concern'd in this Canon, did neither then nor ſince believe any obligation to be ſubject in temporals, and were unſatisfied till they procur'd this Declaration from <hi>Clement</hi> 5 that things were as they were before; and becauſe this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied them 'tis in my opinion a ſtrong proof that it was then known there was no ſubjection in temporals due before. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, the proof from the Canon ſtands plainly thus: You
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:103"/> muſt in vertue of this Canon believe the <hi>Pope</hi> has power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Temporals, becauſe he has a power which by the Canon you cannot know whether it be over temporals or no; Or, you muſt know by the Canon the <hi>Pope</hi> has a temporal Power, which whether it be temporal or no you muſt know from ſomething elſe then the Canon: That is, I muſt know in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Canon, what I cannot know in vertue of the Canon. Which proof being that in vertue whereof I know, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Canon is a proof, which is not a proof.</p>
                     <p>The third Argument is from Councils, and is thus propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Bellarmin. We prove it thirdly from the Councils before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whereof the two laſt were general For how can that be brought into doubt, or depend on the opinion of men, which general Catholick and lawful Councils approve? But theſe ten Councils, and eſpecially the two laſt of Lateran and Lyons do moſt evidently teach that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes may be depos'd by the Pope, when the neceſſity of the Church requires it, and conſequently that the temporal Power of Princes is ſubject, and ſubordinate to the ſpiritual power of Popes.</hi> In my opinion he might have ſpared that <hi>conſequently.</hi> If lawful general Councils evidently teach Depoſition, they teach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of all conſcience; we know well enough what will follow, without the help of his inferences, and know that twenty worſe things will follow then ſubordination of powers. But is <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in earneſt too? and will he reduce the Catholick Church to the narrow compaſs of thoſe who believe his Doctrine? How! Lawful general Concils teach, and that evidently, that Princes may be depoſed! Why, what a hand has he made on't? His Friends, <hi>Coton, Sonran,</hi> and the reſt of the Jeſuites, who by a publick declaration diſavow'd and deteſted this doctrine, were no very honeſt men by his reckoning. The <hi>French</hi> are all direct Hereticks without more ado, and I fear it will go hard with the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, who ſo freely and openly communicates with them. As for my ſmall acquaintance, they are all in as bad a caſe as <hi>Falstaffs</hi> old Hoſts, if ſack be a ſin. They'l be mall'd to my knowledg. If he do not make amends, with the weakneſs of his proofs, for the confidence of his aſſertions, we are all undone. But the comfort is that all Catholicks are not of his mind. For this very Book had the luck to light into a certain Catholick
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:103"/> Country where it was publickly condemn'd, and the men who did it, did not for all that think they contradicted any thing evidently taught by lawful general Councils. But let us ſee what thoſe Councils ſay. The truth is, ſince of ten which he cites, 2 only are general, 8 might have been ſpared. For particular Councils, according to his own doctrine, are not ſo irrefragible, but what they determine may be brought into doubt. But we muſt take his Arguments as they are.</p>
                     <p>His firſt Council is, 900 years old, under <hi>Greg.</hi> 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would make us believe the <hi>Emperor Leo Iſaurus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and depriv'd of the tributes which he uſ'd to receive out of <hi>Italy.</hi> And this is one of the ſtories which <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> takes for fables. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alledges for proof (for the Council is not extant) the teſtimony of <hi>Zonaras</hi> a Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, whoſe words are theſe: <hi>Gregory, who at that time ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church of old Rome, involved them together with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in a ſynodical Anathema, and making a league with the French, forbad the tributes (which till that time were paid) from thence to the Empire. Barclay</hi> anſwers, that he miſtook the meaning of <hi>Zonaras,</hi> thinking that thoſe 2 ſeveral things, becauſe they are joyned in one period, hapned therefore at the ſame time. 'Tis true that either this <hi>Pope,</hi> or his Succeſſor <hi>Greg.</hi> 3 did in a Synod excommunicate, not the Emperor particularly, but <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> in general. 'Tis true that <hi>Greg.</hi> 3. made a league with the <hi>French,</hi> or rather fled to their protection from the injuries of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> from which the <hi>Emperor</hi> either could, or perhaps would not defend him. And therefore Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who ſay that after this league <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> withheld their uſual Tributes, though the matter of fact be not altogether ſo clear, but none ſay they withheld them by the authority of any Council. As far as can be gathered the exaſperated people were willing to keep their mony for their own defence, and not by ſending it into <hi>Greece,</hi> expoſe themſelves defenceleſs to thoſe injuries which they either ſuffered or feared. And thus far there is mention of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s conſent, and even countenance at laſt; for he oppoſed the ſway of the people a good while; and by his authority preſerv'd them in their allegeance to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> yet ſided with them at long run, in this keeping their mony at home. But for depoſing the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:104"/> 
                        <hi>Emperor</hi> much leſs in a Synod, neither he nor any body elſe thought of it, on the contrary to his dying day he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him his <hi>Emperor</hi> and Lord. Whether the People, or he did well in doing ſo much as they did, is another queſtion which belongs not to me to determin. But I ſuppoſe it is no wonderful thing, that a remote Province of a great Empire ſhould upon ſome diſſatisfaction fail at ſome time in their duty, and the men of greateſt Authority among them joyn with them. This is ſtanding upon their terms more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſubjects; but 'tis not depoſing, and much leſs depoſing by the Authority of thoſe great men who take their part. One might as well ſay the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by his Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> becauſe he was the Principal Actor, with thoſe who fell from him. But to make ſhort work with our caſe, there was in it, I think, no depoſition at all. But if this Tribute matter muſt be called depoſition, to that concur'd no Council; and betwixt them both 'tis plain there is no Argument.</p>
                     <p>There comes next in play the famous buſineſs of <hi>Greg.</hi> 7 which takes up 6 Councils more. Theſe becauſe they belong all to one ſubject, you ſhall give me leave to reſpit, till I have rid my hands of his next Council which belongs to another. 'Tis the Council of <hi>Clerment.</hi> where, he ſays, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban.</hi> 2. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and depoſed <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. of <hi>France</hi> for caſting off his lawful Wife, marrying an Adultereſs, and refuſing upon admonition to make ſatisfaction. For this he cites M. <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Sigebert.</hi> I have not ſeen <hi>Sigebert;</hi> but M. <hi>Paris,</hi> who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizes the Acts of the Council, and among the reſt this excommunication, makes no mention of depoſing. I, but, ſayes <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> depoſition muſt be underſtood to go along with excommunication. Marry I thank him heartily. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtood</hi> quotha! Is our evident teaching come to underſtanding, and underſtanding thoſe things to be the ſame than which the world has none more different? Excommunication is a pure ſpiritual cenſure, and deprives a man of none but pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual goods; depoſition is quite contrary, and takes away only temporal. It paſſes my underſtanding how one of theſe muſt neceſſarily follow out of the other. Pray why muſt we underſtand it does? Becauſe ſays he, Hiſtorians teſtify the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:104"/> 
                        <hi>Pope</hi> forbad the Crown ſhould be ſet upon the Kings head while he remain'd excommunicate, and in particular <hi>Ivo</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> writes to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he would be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unleſs he reſtored the Crown; and took off the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that the <hi>King</hi> and Kingdom would fall off from their obedience. Very well. Why then according to <hi>Ivo,</hi> there was a King ſtill, and that King had a Kingdom, and ſo much credit in it that 'twas not impoſſible but he might cauſe it to revolt. Theſe things do not hang together. A man may as ſoon underſtand how excommunication and depoſition infer one another, as how a Crown can be reſtor'd to one who is a King, and has a Kingdom; or how the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould forbid the Crown to be ſet on his head, who had been crowned long before the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Pope.</hi> 'Tis hard and not very wiſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid things that are paſt. If this myſtery had not been unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for me, I had been quite at a loſs. But if I may believe <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Withrington,</hi> it was at that time the cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> for the King to wear his Crown at ſolemn Feſtivals, and for ſome Biſhop to put it on his head. The <hi>Pope</hi> forbad the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to ſerve the King in this Ceremony, it ſeeming impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that perſons of their dignity in the Church, ſhould ſo far communicate with a man deſervedly lying under the cenſures of the Church, as to contribute to his honor, at the ſacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffices. And this is all the Crown of which <hi>Ivo</hi> ſpeaks and talks of reſtoring. 'Twas at moſt a matter of pure ceremony, in which the <hi>Pope</hi> was not obey'd neither. For <hi>Ivo</hi> himſelf writs that, notwithſtanding his commands to the contrary, Biſhops were found, who performed that Office to the King. But for the reſt, the Kings reign was neither interrupted nor diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>France</hi> giving a very good example of the duty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in that caſe, when in the words of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> they preſerv'd inviolate the Majeſty of a faulty Prince, and yet themſelves degenerated not from the holineſs of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. I mention not his additional proof from <hi>Vignier,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had better have let him alone, ſince <hi>Barclay</hi> has caught him tardy, and ſhew'd that what <hi>Vignier</hi> ſays related to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philip</hi> who liv'd a hundred years after this <hi>Philip</hi> of whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeaks. And I conceive He might as well have let alone the Council of <hi>Clermont</hi> as <hi>Vignier,</hi> for there is no proof that the King was depos'd by or in it.</p>

                     <p>To return now to <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. He ſays, <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> publickly and ſolemnly and ceremoniouſly, with the conſent and applauſe of all preſent, depoſed and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the <hi>Emperor Henry</hi> 4. And to this Synod muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 5 more held by his Succeſſors, at <hi>Beneventum</hi> by <hi>Victor</hi> 3 <hi>Piacenza</hi> by <hi>

Of theſe ſix, if <hi>Jo. Barclay</hi> ſay true, five are plainly nothing to the matter: For there is not a word of depoſition in any of them. There is mention of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſometimes of the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf, ſometimes of the <hi>Anti-Pope</hi> ſet up by the <hi>Emperor</hi> and his complices; but depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition not ſo much as once named. Beſides <hi>Henry</hi> 4. with whom <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. had to do, was dead before the times of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> and <hi>Caliſtus;</hi> to make them renue the ſentence of depoſition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven firſt by <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. is a great inadvertence. 'Tis true all his Succeſſors kept up the quarrel about Lay-inveſtitures, and that occaſioned all the Decrees he mentions, and ſome more remembred by <hi>Schulkenius,</hi> till <hi>Caliſtus</hi> with a wiſe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful piety compos'd the difference. And I think it cannot be imagined he ſhould depoſe the <hi>Emperor</hi> with whom he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and concluded Peace. There remains only the fact of <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. himſelf, and that indeed paſt in a Council; but what ſhare the Council had in it, is ſomething obſcure. I ſuſpect he was more beholding to his Rhetorick for thoſe flouriſhing additions of the conſent and applauſe of all preſent, then the warrant of any good authority. For <hi>Platina</hi> ſays expreſly there were ſome preſent ſo far from being fully ſatisfi'd, that they urg'd, a King was not to be excommunicated ſo ſoon. And the Decree it ſelf mentions neither conſent, nor privity of any beſides the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe act the ſtile makes it, and that ſo entirely, that were it not known by other means, it could never be diſcovered by the ſentence, that there was any ſuch thing as a Council then in being. The truth is, the <hi>Pope</hi> was ſmartly provoked. For, beſides that he had been forcibly ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on, even at the Altar, and hurried into priſon, from whence he was the next day reſcued by the people, a Synod of <hi>Worms</hi> called by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> had little better then depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him firſt. <hi>We denounce unto you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:105"/> no obedience to you, ſo from henceforth we mean to pay none.</hi> In conſequence of this Decree one <hi>Roland</hi> a Clergyman of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there publickly forbad the <hi>Pope</hi> to act as <hi>Pope</hi> for the future, and commanded the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to leave him, and repair to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> to receive another <hi>Pope.</hi> Whether he had not begun with the <hi>Emperor</hi> is another queſtion. There are who think he had. But however to be ſo ſharply dealt with would make a man look about him. And 'tis clear, this buſineſs at <hi>Worms</hi> hapned before his ſentence at <hi>Rome,</hi> where 'tis very likely they might think they had as much power to to depoſe the <hi>Emperor;</hi> as they in <hi>Germany</hi> to depoſe the <hi>Pope.</hi> If I may be permitted to ſpeak with freedom I ſhould think this counter-authority of Councils one againſt another (for it was not only <hi>Pope</hi> againſt <hi>Emperor,</hi> but Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil againſt Council) is a more proper argument of human frailty, then Catholick doctrine. One may perceive that Princes never fall out, but there will be partakers on both ſides, and that among thoſe who are leaſt liable to the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being ſway'd to injuſtice, the wiſeſt and graveſt and of greateſt dignity. But how any thing ſhould be efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concluded from Councils, which are oppoſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councils, as many, as full, conſiſting of perſons, the <hi>Pope</hi> excepted, equal in dignity and reputation whether for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or vertue, is hard to conceive. Tumult and Bitterneſs and Animoſity are no very proper diſpoſitions for the calm and gentle operations of the H. Spirit; and ſuch there were at that time, or elſe the world was then a great deal more holy then now. There was among them that would have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed paſſion among us, and things were done by them which paſſionate people do with us; where we ſee the fruits we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſuſpect the Tree. The <hi>Emperor</hi> for his part had the <hi>Pope</hi> to countenance the <hi>Saxons</hi> againſt him, and by his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority counterpoiſe the weight of his arms. This would vex a man of a high ſpirit, ambitious of glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of contradiction unleſs he were a Saint, which is not written of that <hi>Emperor.</hi> On the other ſide, the <hi>Pope</hi> had the <hi>Emperor</hi> averſe to the liberality then intended, and after brought to effect, of the Counteſs <hi>Mathildis,</hi> and unwilling ſo great an occaſion ſhould be made to the Church of lands,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:106"/> to which, if I miſtake not, the <hi>Emperor</hi> pretended. He muſt be a very great Saint too if he could look upon the hopes of ſo great an advantage without paſſion, and not be tempted to weaken a man whom he ſaw would croſs him as much as he could. Theſe reaſons for animoſity, among others, there were and if they did not work, they were the holyer men. But I think no man is bound to believe that the pretences uſed in matters of great conſequence, are alwaies the true cauſes: neither is it hard when people are reſolved to fall out, and ſet the beſt face they can each on his ſeveral ſide, by ſome means or other to draw in the pretence of Religion, which as it carries the faireſt ſhew, is generally neareſt at hand. But I rove too far with my fools bolt. Thoſe who were Actors in theſe matters, have long ſince given account to an Impartial Judg, nor have I to do with their intentions, but <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s argument; which in two words I conceive little efficacious, both becauſe the concurrence of the Council ſeems queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, farther than as it happens ſometimes in conſiſtories, where matters are propos'd in ſome caſes for forms ſake, and ſhall be executed as they are prereſolved, however the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals vote. And though it were not, the Council at moſt is but a particular Council, which according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is of no irrefragable and binding authority. For the reſt 'twere ſtrange, if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould not find Biſhops enough to joyn with the ſpiritual power, when the <hi>Emperor</hi> wanted not who ſtuck as faſt to the temporal. And ſo much to 8 of the 10 Councils.</p>
                     <p>We are now at —<hi>Paulo majora canamus.</hi> The two Councils which remain are propos'd with more pomp, and in truth challenge a greater reſpect, as being general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils both. The firſt is that of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. out of which is urged the famous Canon known by every one, and which for as much as concerns us, runs Thus— <hi>But if a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lord required and admoniſht by the Church, neglect to purge his land from this Heretical filth, let him be excommunicated by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, and Com-provincial Biſhops. And if he ſtand in contempt, and make not ſatisfaction within a year, let the Pope be made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he may from that time declare his Vaſſals abſolved from their fealty to him, and expoſe his lands to be ſeiz'd on by Catholicks, who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:106"/> chacing away the Hereticks may without contradiction poſſeſs, and preſerve it in the purity of Faith, ſaving the right of the principal Lord, provided he bring no obſtacle nor hindrance to the Premiſes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving nevertheleſs the ſame rule with them who have no principal Lords. Bellarmin</hi> is wonderfully agog with this. <hi>What,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would Barclay ſay here? If this be not the voice of the Catholick Church where ſhall we find it? and if it be, as moſt truly it is, he that out of contempt, as Barclay hears it not, is he not to be eſteemed a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Publican, and in no manner a Chriſtian and pious? If the Pope have not power on earth to diſpoſe of temporals, even to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe Princes who either are Hereticks themſelves, or any way favour Hereticks, why, at the ſetting out this Canon, did none of ſo great a number make oppoſition? Why of ſo many Embaſſadors of Emperors and Kings not one who durſt ſo much as mutter? Theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites to temporal Princes were not yet ſprung up, who under pretence of eſtabliſhing temporal Kingdoms take away the eternal Kingdom from thoſe whom they flatter.</hi> I marry! here's a fit of triumphant zeal. But I ſuppoſe if he had caſt a little water on the flame, it would have been hot enough for the occaſion. This <hi>Paraſites</hi> and <hi>Flatterers, Heathens, Publicans</hi> and <hi>Impious</hi> are expreſſions a little too zealous. In what a caſe are they who condemn'd all this zeal, and had they not had more reſpect to his Purple then his argument, in all likelyhood had burnt it too? and yet had as good ears in the opinion of the world; as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and could hear the voice of the Catholick Church as ſoon. But to be ſerious, what <hi>Barclay</hi> would have ſaid here, I cannot tell; but I ſuppoſe if Death had not ſtopt his mouth, he would have ſaid ſomething: For this Canon is no ſuch ſecret that he could be imagin'd ignorant of it, or unprovided againſt it. At leaſt his ſon did find ſomething to ſay for him, to which I can no more tell what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would ſay, then he could what <hi>Barclay</hi> would ſay to the Council. I ſhall have occaſion to mention part of what he ſays by and by. In the mean time as this Council never fails to be layd in the way of all who travel this road, people have ſeveral turns to avoid it.</p>
                     <p>There are who queſtion whether any thing at all was defined there, at leaſt in a Conciliar way, or if any thing were defin'd that the world was duly made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the buſineſs. For which, beſides that ſome Hiſtorians
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:107"/> expreſly ſay nothing was concluded, they have theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. The Canons, which we have, diſcover by their ſtile that they were not made in the Council. They run ſome of them in this manner: <hi>It was piouſly provided in the Lateran Council—'Tis known 'twas forbid in the Lateran Council,</hi> &amp;c. which are phraſes very unlikely to have been uſed by the Council, if that fram'd the Decrees. Again, the whole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Council reſts as far as I ſee upon one <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> The Councils had been ſet out, and this omitted, either not known, or not procurable by him, who managed the buſineſs. Againſt another Edition this <hi>Cochlaeus</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht the Preſs with the Copy which we now have. Whence he had it himſelf, I know not; but methinks the credit of a private man is a weak ſupport for a matter of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Beſides how much time ought in reaſon be allow'd to a Conciliar diſcuſion and determination of threeſcore Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. <hi>Carenza</hi> has threeſcore and ten, and ſomewhere I have heard of another number, which diſagreement by the way is a ſuſpicious thing M. <hi>Paris</hi> tells us the Council was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the firſt of <hi>Nov.</hi> and met, I ſuppoſe, at the day. The <hi>Pope</hi> firſt makes an exhortation, afterwards cauſes 60 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be read, and concludes with a ſecond exhortation concerning the H. Land. All this, as far as can be gather'd by him, paſt in one day; which if it did, the Council could not poſſibly contribute more than the hearing to any thing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he plainly ſays theſe 60 Chapters to ſome appear'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, to others burthenſome; which is very far from a Conciliar approbation. Now he ſays not preciſely when the Council ended, but 'tis apparent by him that it laſted not long. The <hi>Pope</hi> in this Council at the Kings inſtance ſuſpends the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This ſuſpenſion bears date <hi>pridie nonas</hi> or 4th. <hi>Nov.</hi> Beſides he vacats the election of his Brother <hi>Simon Langton</hi> to the Sea of <hi>York,</hi> and excommunicates the Barons of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe ſentences are not recorded as the other, but in liklyhood paſt at the ſame time. M. <hi>Paris</hi> mentions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the end of the Council. <hi>Quo facto</hi> after which, ſays he, two of the three Agents which the King of <hi>England</hi> had there, returned to bring him the good news. They found him at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> from whence he marched to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and came
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:107"/> thither time enough to have the ſuſpenſion of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop atteſted by the ſeal of the Convent 13 <hi>Calend. Jan.</hi> or 20 <hi>Decemb.</hi> By this account how long could the Council laſt? Or how much time could be ſpent in duly weighing ſo many Canons, ſome of ſuch importance, when men who had ſeen the concluſion of the Council which began not before <hi>Nov.</hi> were in <hi>England</hi> by the 20th. of <hi>December?</hi> He has beſides a ſecond ſentence of the <hi>Popes</hi> againſt the Barons of <hi>England</hi> by name, wherein he ſpeaks in this manner. <hi>We would have you know that lately in a General Council we did excommunicate and anathematize the Barons of England—moreover we do excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and anathematize—We aggravate our hand more ſtrongly againſt them,</hi> &amp;c. This bears date 17 <hi>Calend. Jan.</hi> the 16 <hi>Decemb.</hi> of the ſame year, and 'tis clear by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s expreſſions that before this time the Council was ended, and it may be had been a good while. If theſe 60 Canons were all examined with that maturity which becomes a Council, and ſo decreed, Councils at that time were much nimbler then now a dayes. If proceedings then had one quarter of the flegm we uſe now their ſuſpicion is not altogether without ground, who think the conſultations, then on foot were interrupted by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of ſuddain wars, and nothing brought to concluſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Withrington</hi> takes another exception to this Canon, which he ſays comes not home to the purpoſe, nor can by the rules of Law be interpreted to extend to Soveraign Princes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he ſays, in conſtruction of Law ſuch Princes, at leaſt in penal, or as they call them odious matters, are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be included in general words, as <hi>Lords, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> and the like, no more then the <hi>Pope</hi> when only <hi>Biſhop</hi> is named, or Abbot by the word <hi>Monk.</hi> If it had been meant of Soveraign Princes, it had been as eaſy to have named them expreſly, as temporal Lords, and they were ſo named in other Decrees even of this Council. Beſides this very Decree, in the very ſame words, changing only ſpiritual puniſhments into temporal, was publiſht within 5 years by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and it cannot be imagined he meant to make Soveraign Princes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Laws, or had power ſo to do though he meant it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſeveral other things may be ſay'd, but in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they need not: for there is another anſwer free from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:108"/> the intricacies whether of Law or Hiſtory, and which to my apprehenſion is both eaſy and plain. Every body knows that Decrees of Councils are of two ſorts. Some declare what is to be believed, others preſcribe ſomething to be done. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body knows that theſe two are of very different natures. To refuſe Decrees of Faith, is to renounce the communion of that Church whoſe Repreſentative the Council is, that is, the whole Church, if the Council be general, unleſs there be a juſt exception againſt their proceeding. For Faith is that by which a Church is a Church, and if you be of a different Faith, you cannot be of the ſame Church. But for the other ſort of Decrees, when they concern civil matters, becauſe thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to manage them are ſuppoſed to be better acquainted with them then ſpiritual men, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is to attend to ſpirituals, neither reaſon nor cuſtom allows them any force, till they be received by particular Countries, and by that reception made binding. For it were very unreaſonable one Law ſhould bind all Countries, when that which is convenient in one place may be and often is prejudicial in another. We in <hi>England</hi> acknowledg no Law but by conſent of <hi>Parliament.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> they require <hi>Verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as they call it, in their higheſt Courts of Juſtice. Every Country has its particular method; but what has not paſt this teſt is currant no where. And this is a notorious thing, for default of which, there is none who knows not that theſe kind of Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are not obliging in <hi>France</hi> to this day. Again, tis equally notorious that the Canon in queſtion is of this ſecond ſort. Wherefore 'tis as plain as can be, that unleſs it can be made appear. It has been duly receiv'd, and by ſuch reception become binding, of itſelf it is not binding any where, I mean where both powers are not united to command it For where the <hi>Pope</hi> has the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a temporal Prince there both powers concur. I forbear to touch ſeveral things mentioned pertinently enough. As, how Biſhops in Council ſhould order temporal penalties, who out of Council (unleſs they have a ſhare of temporal power communicated otherwiſe to them) cannot go beyond ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. A Congregation of Biſhops is but ſo many Biſhops, nor is it eaſy to conceive how their meeting together ſhould inveſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:108"/> them with an authority of another kind and ſuch as is not proper to Biſhops. To which purpoſe a famous Canoniſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of temporal penalties, inflicted by a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, inquires what the <hi>Pope</hi> had to do with temporals, and anſwers, truly nothing; but he ordered that penalty in vertue of the <hi>Emperors</hi> conſent, who was preſent and approv'd it. So that when Councils make ſuch kind of Decrees, 'twill be hard to make out any other Authority by which they make them, than the conſent of Princes concern'd. But theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeveral other I paſs by, the former being plain in it ſelf and plainly doing the buſineſs. The Decree in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of that kind which all the world knows is not binding but where, and only where tis receiv'd. Either produce this reception, or tis to no more purpoſe to urg it, then to alledg the authority of a Bill thrown out of one of the Houſes, or not aſſented to by the King. Upon the whole, if there had gone a little more knowledg to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s zeal, 'twould have been ſo much the better: He undertakes to prove that general Councils teach evidently that Princes may be depos'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and brings in proof a Decree which teaches nothing, but orders that which none is bound to obey, unleſs he live in a Country who have made it a Law to themſelves, if any ſuch Country there be. And if this be his evident teaching, it will be concluded that his Doctrine in this point can be taught no otherwiſe then by a teaching, which evidently is no teaching.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> concludes with the Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> under <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> 4. in which there was publiſht a ſentence of depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the <hi>Emperor Frederick</hi> 2. This as Art requires at a cloſe, he ſets forth as gloriouſly as he can. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the later part of the ſentence; <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the ſentence of the Soveraign Biſhop with approbation of the whole Council, that is with the conſent and praiſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Christian Prelates. And yet one, I know not who, dares diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt it, and publiſh his Book, and caſt a miſt before the eyes of the ſimple;</hi> and ſo goes on to the end of the Chapter, amplifying the boldneſs and raſhneſs of ſtanding in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſo many and ſo learned, and ſo holy men, whom for the greater ſolemnity he gathers all into one great Council,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:109"/> 
                        <hi>excommunicating and depoſing by Apoſtolick Authority Heretical Princes, or Patrons of Hereticks;</hi> And upon this fancy of making one Council of all ages he is ſo intent, that he quite forgets that Heretical Princes were no part of the caſe in any Age, nor ever thought of by any of his Councils, ſave only that of <hi>Lateran.</hi> To fancy them all into one Council is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but to fancy them doing there what, when they are aſſembled in reality, they dreamt not of, has ſomething too much of fancy. Then this <hi>favouring of Hereticks</hi> is a term ſo general that I know not how far it extends, but I think Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make alliances as they are guided by intereſt of State, and amuſe not themſelves with theſe ſpeculations of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The <hi>French</hi> never bogled to make leagues with Princes of different Religions, which though it has been ſometimes caſt in their diſh, they left not for all that to do what they thought fitting. 'Tis now come about, and the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> does what heretofore they blam'd in the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> is much bely'd if he quarrel with them for it. It is not much more boldneſs and raſhneſs to ſtand upon our terms with his Councils, being ſuch as they are, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn to excommunication and depoſition ſuch as are capable of it, all this part of the world. For ſure Repreſentatives are not ſo much more conſiderable than the Bodies themſelves. But I rove as well as <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I ſpeak to the to the Council, it will not be amiſs to obſerve that the caſe of the <hi>German Emperors</hi> has ſomething not common with other abſolute Princes, and the caſes of <hi>Frederic</hi> 2 and <hi>Henry</hi> 4 ſomething not common with other <hi>Emperors.</hi> For 'tis well obſerv'd by <hi>John Barclay</hi> that ſince the tranſlation of the Empire to the Weſt, at leaſt ſince the devolution from the poſterity of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Popes</hi> have pretended a particular ſuperiority over thoſe <hi>Emperors.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Clem. <hi>5.</hi> Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina Vinc. de Jurejur. Adrian Ep. ad Fred. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> One of them in a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non will needs have the Oath which <hi>Emperors</hi> take at their Coronation to be properly an Oath of Fidelity. Another taxes the <hi>Emperor</hi> of inſolence and arrogance for ſetting his name before the <hi>Popes,</hi> as being contrary to the fidelity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt and ſworn to S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf. In conſequence whereof
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:109"/> there are who maintain the <hi>Pope</hi> may depoſe the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe he acknowledges his Temporalties from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and in plain terms that the Empire and <hi>Emperor</hi> are ſubject to the <hi>Pope.</hi> I have nothing to do with the juſtice of this pretence, let the <hi>Germans</hi> look to that, who, I ſuppoſe, are not all of the ſame opinion: but 'tis manifeſt <hi>Popes</hi> have made this claim, and if they act in conſequence of what they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly maintain and treat as ſubjects thoſe whom they took to be ſo, and deal with them as ſupream Lords with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors and Vaſſals, as it is not to be wondred at, ſo the caſe is quite different from that of abſolute Princes, over whom there is no pretence of ſuperiority. Again, this <hi>Frederick</hi> had poſitively ſworn by <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> particularly authoriz'd to ſtand to the Judgment of the <hi>Pope</hi> and Church. <hi>Henry</hi> 4. had done as much in perſon at <hi>Canoſſa,</hi> upon the recalling of his firſt ſentence. How far this ſubmiſſion of theirs ſubjected thoſe two <hi>Emperors</hi> to the cenſures of the Church, at leaſt how far it might be thought to ſubject them, I cannot ſay. But certainly ſuch an obligation makes their condition dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe who never entred into ſuch bonds.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs likewiſe to reflect a little upon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thoſe times. As far as I can get a Proſpect of them, they were leſs critical then ours, and more led by nature than ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. When a miſchief hapned they thought 'twas fit there ſhould be a remedy, and as drowning men think not of the treſpaſs, and whether the twig they catch at grow on their neighbours ground, if the temporal Power wrong'd them, had recourſe to the ſpiritual, and if the ſpiritual to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral. So the <hi>Emperor Otho</hi> was ſollicited to relieve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>John</hi> 12 and did ſo, cauſing him to be depos'd, and a better choſen in his room. And every body thought he did well, even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf (though withal he thinks the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not ſo regular) becauſe that <hi>Pope</hi> was a very wicked man. Beſides, the <hi>Pope</hi> was believ'd the Father and Head of all Chriſtians, and upon that account obedience due to him from all. How far and to what kind of actions this obedience extended, they ſeem to have ſo little conſidered that <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. himſelf anſwers, thoſe who were not ſatisfi'd with his haſty ſentence,<note place="margin">Plat. in Greg. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> as if it were all one to have power over all and to have all Power. It was this Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> which made men begin to look about them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106994:110"/> and conſider the matter more deeply. For then, ſays M. <hi>Paris</hi> both Princes and prelates foreſeeing the conſequences were exceedingly troubled. For though <hi>Frederick</hi> himſelf did many ways deſerve to be leſſened and depriv'd of all honor, yet to be depos'd by <hi>Papal</hi> authority, would raiſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to that height and pride that abuſing the Grace of God they might fall to depoſing even innocent and good Princes, and ſooner Prelates, and this for ſlight cauſes, or at leaſt threaten to depoſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whatever they thought afterwards, when they reflected the <hi>Pope</hi> was a man as well as his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and might abuſe an unlimited power; at the Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> I conceive they were more intent to conſider who had right of his ſide, then with what kind of penalty they were impour'd to chaſtiſe the wrong. The <hi>Emperors</hi> Agents were heard, and notwithſtanding all they could ſay in his behalf, and they ſpoke freely enough, He was in the opinion of the whole Council manifeſtly guilty. Even thoſe who favour'd him at firſt, confeſt he deſerv'd to be depos'd. And if the reſt thought no injuſtice done him, who had but what he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I think the wonder is not great.</p>
                     <p>However it be to anſwer more directly, divers things they ſay, They queſtion the concurrence of the Council, and think <hi>Bellarmin</hi> a little more confident then became him, to talk of the <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> of the whole Council, when the Decree is ſo far from authorizing his confidence, that on the contrary it affords juſt ſuſpicion of the contrary. For whereas the uſual ſtile of conciliar Acts, and elſewhere us'd even in this very Council, runs in this manner, <hi>ſacro ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probante Concilio,</hi> 'tis changed here into this, <hi>ſacro praeſente Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio,</hi> which they think not done without a particular reaſon. Again, Hiſtorians mention the horror and aſtoniſhment of the by-ſtanders at the pronouncing the ſentence, effects not likely to proceed from an Act of their own. In fine, ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions they take. But the beſt anſwer in my opinion is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf. He teaches elſewhere, that in Councils the greateſt part of the Acts belong not to Faith,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. c. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> neither Diſputations, nor Reaſons, nor Explications, but the bare Decrees themſelves, and thoſe not all, but only ſuch as are propos'd for Faith. This being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it is univerſally, the difficulty is plainly anſwered. For 'tis as plain as can be, that here is nothing propos'd for Faith.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:110"/> The <hi>Emperor</hi> is depos'd, his depoſition is that which is decreed and that is propos'd as a thing to be done, not believed. To depoſe is one thing, to define they have power to depoſe is another. Had they made ſuch a Decree and obliged all Chriſtians under <hi>Anathema</hi> to believe, it had been to purpoſe to alledg it. But as far as I can learn, there was no thought of any ſuch thing in the Council. Now for Acting, People may act, and ſometimes very rationally upon probable grounds, and ſuch as none are bound to believe. And they may have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good grounds for acting in one caſe, which themſelves may not think ſufficient in another. It is very unreaſonable out of a particular action to conclude a power which ſhall extend to all caſes, when from the bare action there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of believing a power even in that caſe. The moſt that can be made of it is, that the Council ſuppos'd, or took for granted they had power to do what they did. And it may be they had. For the <hi>Emperor</hi> had ſworn particularly to ſtand to the Judgment of the Church: He pleaded in this Council by his Procurators, who when they ſaw things go againſt them, made no exception to the Jurisdiction of the Court, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to a future Council more general, pretending all were not preſent who had right to ſit there. But why may not a Council take for granted more then every body is obliged to grant? This ſuppoſition of theirs was undoubtedly one of the Reaſons of their Decree. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> aſſures us we are not bound to believe any of their reaſons. So that for his particular, he had no reaſon to expect this Decree ſhould cauſe belief in any. But whether he had or no, this is plain without him. That where there is nothing to be believ'd there can be no belief, and where there is nothing, in his languag, propos'd for Faith, there is nothing to be believ'd. Here is ſomething commanded, but nothing defin'd, and as ſure as no Maſs no hundred Mark, no Definition, no Article of Faith. Wherefore I cannot ſufficiently wonder to ſee learned men lay ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about them, ſome with great formality citing the Council and heightning its authority by reckoning up the number and quality of thoſe who met there; others ſtriving to diminiſh it by conſulting Hiſtorians, and carefully obſerving all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they afford; when all this while the Authority of it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applys it ſelf, nor can be applyed to the matter in hand. For tis evident they defined nothing, one way or other, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:111"/> afford us no more then a bare matter of fact, paſt indeed in, or by a Council, but whatever be true, or whether the Fact were juſt or unjuſt, our belief is not a jot concern'd, and this even by the confeſſion of thoſe who moſt urg the Council. The Fate of eager Diſputers is upon us, with much ado we are where we were again; and muſt either be taught this Doctrine by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which teach nothing, or which neither are, nor were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for teaching Decrees, or not to be taught it all, as far as I perceive For this is the ſum total of his ten Councils.</p>
                     <p>His fourth and laſt Argument is, He ſays, from Scripture; and if you will pardon a ſcurvy pun, tis indeed very far from it, ſo far that one would not readily perceive what Scripture has to do with it. As tedious as it is to tranſcribe, I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the pains of ſetting down, and you to the patience of reading his whole Diſcourſe; for fear I ſhould be ſuſpected of wronging it by contracting. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>We prove it from the divine writings, as Greg.</hi> 7 <hi>proves it in</hi> 21 <hi>Epiſtle of the</hi> 8 <hi>Book. For we find the Eccleſiaſtical Primacy of the Biſhop of Rome moſt manifeſtly founded on Scripture and Tradition, in which Primacy is contained moſt ample Power of governing, binding and looſing whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, even Kings and Emperors: and this neither Barclay, nor any Catholick denies. But out of this principle is gathered plainly enough, that there is in the Biſhop of Rome a power to diſpoſe of temporals, even to the depoſition of thoſe Kings and Emperors. For by that ſpiritual Power the Pope can bind ſecular Princes by the bond of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; by the ſame he can looſe the people from their Oath of Fidelity and Obedience; he can oblige the ſame People, under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not to obey the excommunicated King, and chuſe them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beſides, ſince the end of ſpiritual government is the gaining eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, which is the ſupream and laſt end to which all other ends are ſubordinate; of neceſſity all ſecular Power muſt be ſubject and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the ſpiritual power of the ſupream Eccleſiaſtical Hierarch; which (ſecular power) he is to direct, and if it deviate, correct and judge, and in fine bring to paſs that it hinder not the ſalvation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people. And this is the reaſon why both Greg.</hi> 7 <hi>and Innocent</hi> 4. <hi>when they depos'd Emperors, to ſhew they did it juſtly, alledg'd the words of our Lord:</hi> Whatever you ſhall bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatever you ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>And</hi> feed my Sheep. <hi>Jo.</hi> 21. <hi>namely to ſignify that their power to diſpoſe of temporals, when the ſalvation of ſouls, the ſafety of Religion, and preſervation of the Church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:111"/> require it, depends not on the uncertain opinions of men, but the divine Ordination of Chriſt, the eternal King and higheſt Biſhop, and</hi> who above all is God bleſſed for ever, <hi>according to the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 11.</p>
                     <p>This is every word of what he calls proof from Scripture; if you or any elſe think it ſo, you ſhall find me reaſonable. But indeed it ſticks with me. Let us ſee, <hi>The Eccleſiaſtical Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Pope,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is founded in Scripture and Tradition, and this Primacy extends to Kings and Emperors, and contains moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple power, of governing, binding and looſing, and this no Catholick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Very well; and becauſe I muſt acknowledg my ſelf a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi> I muſt acknowledg I think it all very true. Thus far we are right. Only I take this moſt ample Power to mean no more then moſt ample Eccleſiaſtical power, for that is all which Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Primacy imports; which Eccleſiaſtical Power, that it extends to Kings and Emperors, no King nor Emperor, who acknowledges the Eccleſiaſtical Primacy, ſcruples to admit. For they take themſelves to be part of the flock of Chriſt, and claim their ſhare in the benefit of the Keys, as well as others. <hi>But out of this Principle,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the depoſing Power is plainly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> The Controverſy ſure will quickly be at an end now. Scripture is acknowledged on all hands, and what is plainly there, or may be plainly deduc'd from thence, will find a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſubmiſſion from every body. And though I ſuſpect this <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering</hi> will go near to take the buſineſs out of the hands of Scripture; yet, ſince it is no great matter who does it, ſo the Miracle be done, let us only obſerve at preſent how he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this plain inference of his, and how it follows, if the <hi>Pope</hi> be inveſted with the Power belonging to Eccleſiaſtical Primacy, he is inveſted likewiſe with the Power of depoſing Kings. It is worth while to attend a little to a matter of this conſequence, and a little attention will ſerve turn, where things are ſo plain. Pray, how does this follow ſo plainly? why thus ſays <hi>Bellarmin; Becauſe the Pope by his ſpiritual Power can bind even Kings with the bond of Excommunication.</hi> Suppoſe he can; what then? <hi>And by the ſame he can looſe people from their Oath of Fidelity and Obedience, and oblige them under excommunication not to obey the former excommunicated King, but chuſe them a new one.</hi> How! He can abſolve ſubjects from the duty of Obedience, and oblige them to chuſe a new King. Why this is the very thing call'd Depoſing, and if he can depoſe, undoubtedly he can depoſe. But whether he can do this, is the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:112"/> and what he undertook to prove by a plain collection out of Scripture, and does he offer us for proof the very thing to be prov'd? This it neither proving nor gathering, but ſaying twice over, what they, who deny once, will deny as often as it is or can be repeated, till it be prov'd. Tis in plain terms to ſay, he can looſe the band of Allegeance, therefore he can looſe the band of Allegeance, or he can Depoſe, therefore he can Depoſe. In good earneſt I ſhould not eaſily have believed that ſuch a man as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould have over-ſeen himſelf ſo much: But I perceive the greateſt men that are, are men, and have their failings. And though I ſhould not have run proud of my own wit, if I alone had obſerv'd a defect ſo palpable, yet I muſt needs confeſs I am not the firſt diſcoverer. <hi>Jo. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> has been before me, (and it may be as many as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Argument) as the truth is I ſay, almoſt nothing which I have not from others. If you remember I engaged no farther then to acquaint you what others ſay, and I am as good as my word. But it is ſo tedious and hobling a labor to be alwayes going over and over again with <hi>This man ſays that,</hi> and <hi>t'other man the other,</hi> that I cannot endure alwaies to cite my Authors. But to return to our matter; All we have here in proof of the depoſing power, is that the <hi>Pope</hi> has it: which he that will take for a proof, may; but I fear that who believs it for that reaſon, had as good believe it for no reaſon at all. And how much ſoever there may be of Reaſon, I verily think there is little of Scripture in it.</p>
                     <p>There follows the ſubordination of the two Powers, from the ſubordination of their ends which is one of the 5 Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments related in my former Letter, and which to repeat again I ſuppoſe would be as ungrateful to you, as tedious to me. But there <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alledg'd it as an Argument from Reaſon, and how he comes here to intitle it to Scripture I cannot gueſs. The truth is I am wholly to ſeek why theſe two together, and theſe two are all, which belong to this Head, ſhould be called proof from Scripture, when no place of Scripture is ſo much as alledged. He aſſumes indeed that Eccleſiaſtical Primacy is founded in Scripture and Tradition. But this is part of the queſtion. No Catholick diſputes it with him. The queſtion is whether the Scripture teach the depoſing Power is joyned to that Primacy. I would fain ſee that place of Scripture which teaches this. When <hi>Bellarmin</hi> undertook to prove his doctrine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:112"/> by Scripture, I expected, as I think any man would he ſhould produce ſome place which teaches it either expreſly, or ſo that it might plainly be gathered from it. And inſtead of this he brings us one reaſon, ſuch as it is, and another which is not ſo much as a reaſon, but a bare ſaying over what he was to prove, and this he calls proof from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>He cites indeed in the Proceſs of his diſcourſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and <hi>Jo.</hi> 21. but does not go about to ſhew how they are to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; only by way of Hiſtory tells us that two <hi>Popes</hi> alledg'd them, to ſhew that they dealt juſtly, and that the power they challenged, is not founded on uncertain opinions, but divine Authority. Undoubtedly theſe <hi>Popes</hi> had reaſon to deſire it ſhould be thought they dealt juſtly, and that this power of theirs was not founded on uncertain opinions. And every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows they have alledged thoſe places and more. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body is not ſatisfied with thoſe allegations, nor can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by them that divine Authority does indeed warrant their depoſing claim, neither does <hi>Bellarmin</hi> contribute any thing to their ſatisfaction. They find in S. <hi>Hierom that the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Key extends it ſelf not to Temporals without arrogance;</hi> and ſome body elſe from S. <hi>Jo. Chryſoſtom</hi> has told them, <hi>that by the Keys is not underſtood any power given, but ſpiritual, to abſolve from the bond of Sin,</hi> and <hi>that it were fooliſh to underſtand it of a Power to abſolve from the bond of debt.</hi> And if they think it as wiſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo, as to underſtand it of a Power to abſolve from the bond of Allegeance, they may do ſo for <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> But you have a great deal to this purpoſe cited formerly, and much more might be added if it were neceſſary; by which it may be gather'd, ſomething more plainly then <hi>Bellarmin</hi> gathers, that the Church underſtood not the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> as thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> would have us underſtand the 16 of S. <hi>Mathew.</hi> The like is of the other place of <hi>Feeding:</hi> of which you obſerv'd unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that to underſtand it of Depoſing, is to think Chriſt meant his Sheep ſhould be fed with knocks. Upon that occaſion you know I brought you S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> affirming that to <hi>feed</hi> is no more then to <hi>Evangelize. Fac opus Evangeliſtae, &amp; Paſtoris munus impleſti.</hi> I could eaſily produce Authority enough for the right ſence of this place: But another of the 5 Arguments mention'd in my laſt being drawn from hence, you ſee there are all that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> could make of it, which I have no mind to ſay again.</p>
                     <p>Several other Arguments there are ſcattered up and down
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106994:113"/> by ſeveral Authors. But I take theſe to be the principal. At leaſt they are thoſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> choſe, and he being look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Principal Patron of this opinion, I think it needles to look after more, and in his judgment worſe. It is now time to acquaint you with the arguments produc'd on the other ſide, and the anſwers to them. You ſhall permit me to contract them into as little room as I can: for my Letter ſwells, and I am weary both of writing and of the ſubject. I take them out of <hi>Withrington</hi> and <hi>Barclay,</hi> who being the lateſt writers, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have ſeen what was ſayd before, though the truth is I am forc'd to uſe them more by neceſſity then choice, my library not affording me thoſe former Books whom I would gladly ſee.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, ſays <hi>Withrington,</hi> is like that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes againſt thoſe who aſſert a <hi>direct</hi> Temporal Power in the Pope. <hi>If the Pope have, and that by Divine Right, power to depoſe Princes in order to ſpiritual good, this muſt appear either by Scripture or Tradition. Tradition is not pretended. Out of Scripture, the two chief places are thoſe now mentioned,</hi> Mat. 16. and Joh. 21. <hi>both which he endeavours to ſhew are meant only of ſpiritual power.</hi> To this <hi>Schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenius</hi> for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> replys, <hi>He labours in vain to prove theſe places are meant of ſpiritual power for this they freely grant him. But,</hi> ſay they, <hi>this power which formally is ſpiritual, is virtually temporal, or his the vertue to extend it ſelf to temporals, in as much as is requiſite to ſpiritual good. And therefore</hi> Bellarmins <hi>Argument is good, becauſe he intended only to prove by it that the Popes power was formally ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, which is true, and acknowledged by</hi> Withrington. <hi>But</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thringtons <hi>naught, becauſe he does not prove that the Power is not virtually Temporal, and cannot extend to depoſition,</hi> &amp;c. If I had a mind to anſwer for <hi>Withrington,</hi> I ſhould not think my ſelf ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd by this reply. For when he ſays the Arguments are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the one good the other bad, I cannot perceive by what reaſon one ſhould believe him. <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Argument is good, ſays he, becauſe his Concluſion (that the Popes Power is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual) is true: as if the Argument were a jot the better becauſe the Concluſion is true. The Argument is naught if the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion follow not from the premiſſes, though it be never ſo great a truth otherwiſe. But what was the Argument? No <hi>direct</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Scripture, therefore no <hi>direct</hi> Power. This I take is <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> Argument; and by the favour of <hi>Schulkenius,</hi> no depoſing Power in Scripture, therefore no depoſing Power is ſo like it, that they muſt be both good or neither. That the Concluſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106994:113"/> of the one is true, and the other falſe, is voluntarily ſaid, and nothing to purpoſe: for the queſtion is whether they have not the ſame dependance on their premiſſes. If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> conclude well againſt the Canoniſts, becauſe they cannot ſhew their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> Power in Scripture, I ſee not why <hi>Withrington</hi> concludes not as well againſt <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> unleſs he can ſhew his depoſing Power in Scripture; which as far as I ſee <hi>Schulkenius</hi> does not go about to do. But I have nothing to do with <hi>Withrington,</hi> he has anſwer'd for himſelf, though by ill luck I have not the Book now by me. I am only to obſerve how the caſe ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two parties; which in ſhort is thus: Is the depoſing Power in Scripture, ſays <hi>Withrington?</hi> 'Tis virtually, ſays <hi>Schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenius.</hi> I fear this is no very direct anſwer, and ſuppoſe <hi>VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrington</hi> ſhould ask again: Is this vertue apparent in Scripture? To which <hi>Schulk</hi> gives me no ground to judge what he would reply. And ſo I muſt leave them as I find them, and paſs to the Second Argument. <hi>Coercitive Civil, and coercitive ſpiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being different and independent Powers, muſt have diſtinct Courts and diſtinct penalties. VVherefore as the Civil Power cannot inflict a ſpiritual puniſhment, ſo neither can the ſpiritual Power inflict a civil puniſhment.</hi> And this he ſtrengthens by two Conſiderations. 1. <hi>That the diſtinction of the two Courts, ſince in the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the perſons and cauſes brought before them, and all other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities they may agree, muſt be taken from the difference of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, or nothing.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe no Commonwealth, looking only into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can deprive a ſubject of other goods then ſuch as are proper to that Commonwealth; the ſpiritual can only take away ſpiritual goods, as the temporal only temporal.</hi> They anſwer. <hi>The two Powers are diſtinct, but not wholly independent, when they club into one myſtical Body,</hi> viz. the Church, <hi>in which caſe the temporal is ſubject to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and therefore though the temporal cannot meddle with the ſpiritual, the ſpiritual may with the temporal</hi> And for his additional Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, they ſlight the firſt as being nothing but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his argument repeated: yet ſay however <hi>that Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments are not ſo proper to Temporal power, but they may be inflicted by the ſpiritual.</hi> And to the ſecond, <hi>that in Commonwealths ſubordinate, the ſuperior may deprive the ſubject not only of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges proper to it ſelf, but thoſe alſo which belong to the inferior Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi> This anſwer reliſhes much better with me then the former, for it plainly denies at leaſt half of, what is aſſumed, namely that the powers are independent, which is a direct and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:114"/> allowable anſwer for ſo much. But for the other half, they deal not ſo cleverly. They allow the powers diſtinct even in their penalties, and yet maintain that one may award the penalties of the other, which looks as if they were not diſtinct in their penalties. Again, they ſay they are diſtinct, but aſſign not in what they are diſtinct. They deny not what <hi>Withrington</hi> aſſumes that they may uſe the ſame proceedings, take cognizance of the ſame matters, convene the ſame perſons; And if they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſame penalties too, by what ſhall they be diſtinguiſht? So that I think they had no ſuch great reaſon to ſlight his firſt conſideration. For certainly diſtinct powers muſt be diſtinct in ſomething. But you ſee where it reſts. <hi>Withrington,</hi> ſince they deny it, is oblig'd to prove the Independence of the two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which whether he have done or no, I cannot tell. Shall I tell you my thoughts freely. I ſuſpect the old School-Proverb, <hi>An Aſs may deny more more than Ariſtotle can prove,</hi> may have ſome place here, and that the Anſwerer has ſtill the better end of the ſtaff. When it was <hi>Bellarmins</hi> turn to prove the dependance and ſubordination of the two Powers, and <hi>Withringtons</hi> to anſwer, you may perceive by my laſt where you have the Argument, He could deal well enough with <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Now they have changed ſides, and <hi>Withrington</hi> is on the proving hand, how it will happen I know not.</p>
                     <p>The third Argument is from the multitude of inconveniences which follow from the other opinion. As, <hi>that the Pope may as well take the life, as Kingdom of any Prince,</hi> and driving it a little higher, <hi>authorize any private man to turn Aſſaſſin, and kill the King by treachery, when he cannot be conveniently depos'd.</hi> To this they ſay they can anſwer eaſily enough: but yet as eaſy as it is they do it not. All they reply is, <hi>let this paſs as nothing to purpoſe: meer bugbears to render the Papacy odious, when of ſo many Princes who have been depos'd, ſo many who have periſht by violent deaths, what by the treachery of their ſubjects, what by the force of their Enemys, not one has been kill'd by any Pope or his command. Even Antipopes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their greateſt enemyes, have found not only ſafety, but gentle and favourable uſage from them when they have faln into their hands.</hi> This they amplyfy, and dreſs as handſomly as they can; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks after all tis but a ſorry diſh. For ſure tis no God-a-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the opinion, that <hi>Popes</hi> have been better men, then It would have made them. On the contrary, ſince they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good men becauſe they did not do what the opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:114"/> what muſt the opinion be, which if they had follow'd they had not been good men. That they did not do ill, they owe to their own vertue, but that they might have done ill, makes the opinion naught. At leaſt I conceive ſo, and had I been in their place, would rather have given no anſwer then ſuch a one</p>
                     <p>For another inconvenience he urges, that <hi>Princes may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and murthered for any crime which in the judgement of the Pope deſerves it; if he ſell a Biſhoprick, plunder a Church, fall into any ſort of wickedneſs, nay, if he live not according as his ſtate and condition requires.</hi> To this laſt they except, as a wreſting of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> words beyond his intention; but for the reſt, reply again, that <hi>'tis another odious amplification, and that it may be underſtood for what cauſes Princes may be depos'd by the ſentences againſt</hi> Hen. 4. <hi>and</hi> Fred. 2. <hi>In general, that the cauſes muſt be very weighty, and ſuch that the puniſhment be to edification not deſtruction.</hi> I muſt acknowledge my dulneſs, and that I comprehend not the force of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. To my apprehenſion by the ſentences againſt theſe two Emperors can be known no more, then the reaſon why theſe two Emperors were depoſed; from whence it may be gathered that for the ſame faults a Prince may become liable to the ſame puniſhment; but whether there be any other depoſing faults, and which they be, cannot, I think, be underſtood by them. Then again theſe <hi>weighty,</hi> and <hi>to edification-cauſes</hi> may, for any thing they ſay to the contrary, be any which the Pope judges ſuch; Now this is that which <hi>VVithrington</hi> objects; and I had thought that to ſay the ſame with my Adverſary, had not been to anſwer him.</p>
                     <p>The third Inconvenience is, that, <hi>not only the Pope, but every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may depoſe by this doctrine</hi> (and with a little more ſtretching, perhaps every Curate too) <hi>where the Prince belongs to their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or Pariſh.</hi> And this he juſtifies by an argument of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> againſt the Canoniſts, which he puts thus, <hi>If the Pope be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of the whole Chriſtian world, every Biſhop is Lord of the Towns ſubject to his Biſhoprick; for what the Pope is in the univerſal Church, every Biſhop is in his own Dioceſs.</hi> They reply, that <hi>by this argument it may perhaps be concluded, that a Biſhop may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Prince as well as the Pope, but not depoſe him; becauſe though he be in his Dioceſs what the Pope is in the Church, as much as amounts to being truly a Paſtor, and truly a ſpiritual Prince, not a Vicar or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Delegate; yet the Pope has more power over the whole, then a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over his particular. For which reaſon depoſition was reſerv'd to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:115"/> the Pope in the Council of</hi> Lateran. <hi>VVherefore</hi> Bellarmins <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good, and</hi> Withringtons <hi>naught.</hi> He who undertakes the defence of another muſt ſtand to it, that his man is ſtill in the right: but otherwiſe I ſee not why one argument ſhould be thought good and the other bad. If the Pope be a temporal Prince, the Biſhop is a temporal Prince, ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> becauſe he is in his part what the Pope is in the whole: this is good, ſays <hi>Schulkenius.</hi> If the Pope be a virtually temporal Prince, the Biſhop is a virtually temporal Prince, ſays <hi>VVithrington,</hi> and for the ſame reaſon, how comes this to be bad? becauſe ſays <hi>Schulkenius,</hi> the Pope has more power over the whole then the Biſhop over his particular. This belongs to Biſhop-craft, which I underſtand not; but if it be true, firſt <hi>Bellarmins</hi> argument is as bad as <hi>VVithringtons;</hi> for it may be reply'd to it, that it does not follow the Biſhop is a temporal Prince though the Pope be, becauſe though the Biſhop be no Vicar, yet he has not the power which the Pope has. And then again, though the Pope be a greater virtually temporal Prince then the Biſhop, yet the Biſhop is a virtually temporal Prince too, and may proceed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond excommunication, and ſpiritual juriſdiction, and ſet his hand to temporals. For if ſpiritual power be virtually tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Biſhop have it, and this in his own right as well as the Pope, not by way of delegation, I hope he may uſe what he has, and diſpoſe of temporal things in order to ſpiritual good. And where ſhall this ſtop? To mention as he does reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations is to grant that it belongs to the nature of the power, though the extent of it were afterwards confin'd by conſent. Beſides reſervations are temporary and changeable things, and what is reſerv'd to day may not be ſo to morrow. However if the greater virtually temporal Prince may depoſe Kings, ſure the leſſer may depoſe private men: for this temporal vertue muſt be able to do ſomething in Temporals. And thus much is inconvenience enough in conſcience, though I ſee not well how he avoids the other. Were I to anſwer <hi>Sculkenius,</hi> I ſhould except againſt his underſtanding the <hi>Samenes</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> puts in <hi>Pope</hi> and Biſhop, of being both ſpiritual Princes not Vicars, which I verily think is to make <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay what he never dreamt of, or if he did, was quite from his purpoſe: But that is not my buſineſs. I am only to obſerve how matters ſtand, which are as you ſee.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place <hi>Withrington</hi> urges that <hi>this ſupream power over
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:115"/> temporals delivered in ſuch general and unlimited terms, not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how great, or what kind of ſpiritual good that muſt be, in order to which Depoſition is lawful, ſeems a juſt occaſion of perpetual ſuſpicion and jealouſy in Princes, and apt to diſturb the publick quiet,</hi> &amp;c. They anſwer, <hi>Chriſt may as juſtly be reprehended for delivering the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al power in general terms; as Commonwealths for ſubmitting in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to obedience of Princes whom they create.</hi> Whereof I take nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be true: for Commonwealths have things call'd Laws and Cuſtoms by which doubts riſing from general expreſſions are explained. And for the general expreſſion in the Goſpel, <hi>whatever you ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. I hope he will not perſwade us, but as general as it ſounds to us, it was very particularly underſtood by the Apoſtles. And as they underſtood it, ſo they practis'd and ſo they taught, and among other things, ſubjection to Princes, notwithſtanding the amplitude of that Commiſſion. But if both were true, ſtill the inconvenience remains, for ought I can ſee; ſince whatever be the reaſon of the general terms us'd in the Goſpel and elſewhere, it abates nothing of the jealouſy and ſuſpicion riſing from the unlimited expreſſions of this doctrine. Upon the whole, they ſeem plainly to grant all the inconveniences objected by <hi>VVithrington;</hi> which is to confeſs that, as far as this Topick is effectual, They are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They ſlight the place as nothing to purpoſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſince 'tis the Goſpel rule to judge of the Tree by the fruit and ſince Logick allows the Topick, I think they were oblig'd to ſhew either that the inconveniences were not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, or elſe that they did not follow, and in fine have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered better if they could.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Argument is from the <hi>practice of the Church, begun with the Church it ſelf, and continued for many ages: no mention in Scripture or ancient Fathers of a power either in Pope or People to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, or kill even perſecuting Princes; but all is unanimous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant exhortation to patience and obedience. Now if there be any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Goſpel for Chriſtians, when they come to be ſtrong enough, to caſt off ſuch Princes as are enemies to the Church, we muſt needs have heard of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVithrington</hi> dilates, but this is the ſubſtance. They anſwer two things: Firſt, That <hi>the practice of the Church varies according to different times. That for the firſt</hi> 300 <hi>years ſhe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd patience becauſe ſhe could do no other, there being no Prince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd to protect her; afterwards it became the practice by means of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princes to reſiſt Infidel or Heretick, or any way injurious to her,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:116"/> whether Princes or People.</hi> And for this they largely inſtance in the ſeveral expeditions made for the recovery of the Holy Land, all commanded, ſay they, by ſeveral Popes, and their commands obey'd by Chriſtian Princes. I begin to ſuſpect I do not underſtand what we are talking of: if I do, certainly this is nothing to it. I thought the queſtion had been whether ſubjects may lawfully deſert their own Prince, and refuſe to perform the obedience due to them by Law and Oath, upon the Popes command to the contrary, and <hi>Sculkenius</hi> talks of one Prince making war with another. No man doubts, or if any do, our buſineſs has nothing to do with his doubt, but that Catholick Princes may lawfully make war, and the Pope lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to it to protect innocence, and hinder oppreſſion whether of Eccleſiaſtical or other right. But this is a caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Prince and Prince; ours, if I underſtand it, is betwixt Prince and Subject. For my life I cannot underſtand what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the holy war has to this matter: nor can I imagin what ſhare the Pope had in it, more then a man of zeal and credit to perſwade them, as any other might have done, to a good work. I do not believe any Prince who went thither thought himſelf oblig'd by the Popes commands, or that he commanded any to go, except in the caſe of Vow, or the like engagement of his own. 'Twas zeal, not obedience which carried Princes thither. In ſhort, if <hi>Schulkenius</hi> mean this practiſe, which he ſays was introduc'd of reſiſting force by force of Princes interpoſing for the relief of innocence as they ſaw occaſion, he ſpeaks of another matter: If he mean that when ſubjects get force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough they may uſe it againſt their own Soveraign, upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Popes authority, he teaches us a piece of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which I would adviſe ſhould by all means be kept care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conceal'd from thoſe Infidels whom in the <hi>Indies</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where zealous men ſeek to convert. If ever they get any ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, farewel all hopes of the progreſs of Chriſtianity. 'Tis in truth a poſition extreamly falſe, and extreamly ſhameful. Their ſecond Anſwer is, that <hi>Withrington</hi> is out, when he affirms there is no mention in Scripture or the ancient Fathers of depoſing or killing Perſecutors. <hi>For there is mention in both of Saul depos'd by Samuel, and David plac'd in his room: Of Agag kill'd: Of ten Tribes taken by Ahias from the houſe of David and given to Jereboam: Of Kings ſet up and pul'd down by Elias both in Iſrael and Syria: Of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu made King by a Prophet, and Joram both depos'd and kill'd: Of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:116"/> thalia, and Ozias, one kill'd, the other depos'd for Leproſy: Of Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my plac'd over Nations and Kingdoms, to pluck up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees fighting ſucceſsfully againſt Antiochus. And it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but the High Prieſt among Chriſtians has as great, or greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the High Prieſt among the Jews:</hi> where they repeat again the two places. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. and that depoſing power is neceſſary to the integrity of the commiſſion given by them: and conclude with <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> who ſays nothing to the purpoſe. Some think <hi>Bellarmin</hi> wrote this book, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the name of <hi>Schulkenius</hi> to diſguiſe his own. <hi>Tenderdown</hi> Steeple had as much to do with <hi>Sandwich</hi> Haven, as this with the Depoſing Power. It were eaſy to ſhew as much of every one of theſe examples, if I would take the pains to run them over particularly: but ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf ſlights them, I may be permitted to do ſo too, and ſave that labor. I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve that the High Prieſt among the Jews interven'd in few of theſe examples, and to conclude a power in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian High Prieſt by a parity with the Jewiſh High Prieſt from inſtances where there was no exerciſe of his Power, is a ſhortneſs of which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was too ſharp-ſighted to be guilty. That which <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> ſays, is that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was a wicked man, and deſerved death: which is <hi>Tenderdown</hi> Steeple again. A Prince no doubt may be a wicked man, there have been more in the world beſides <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and more have taken notice of their wickedneſs beſides <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus.</hi> But what then? Neither does he mention, nor do I know any tribunal, which can call them to account for their wickedneſs but that of the laſt day, from whoſe impartial Juſtice Princes ſhall be no more exempt then other men. And to that we muſt leave them.</p>
                     <p>The laſt is rather a Tranſition then an Argument at leaſt the force of it depends on what follows. <hi>Withrington</hi> makes it in this manner. <hi>To ſubject Princes to another power without ſufficient reaſon, is plain injury to Princes, and plain treaſon. But Bellarmins reaſons, which are the beſt, are inſufficient,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo goes on to examin and diſprove them, as I have already inform'd you. They reply by retorting the ſame Argument. <hi>As tis wicked to ſubject the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Princes, ſo tis both wicked and ſacrilegious to diminiſh the Power given by Chriſt without ſufficient reaſon; but the reaſons of VVithring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Barclay are inſufficient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They farther deny either that he has, or can anſwer Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>reaſons, or that he has done his buſineſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106994:117"/> though he could, becauſe another may have better.</hi> But unles they would inform us where thoſe better reaſons are to be found, there can be no more done, then to deal with thoſe, which He who is moſt in vogue thought the beſt. For the reſt, theſe are floriſhes on both ſides; The matter reſts upon this iſſue, which of the two has the beſt reaſons, and he that has will carry it. Tis time for me to leave it with you to ſtand for the Plaintiff or Defendant as you ſee cauſe, and eaſe my ſelf of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful labour.</p>
                     <p>You ſee what is ſaid on both ſides To tell you what the world thinks of their ſayings, is not ſo eaſy. The world is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick world, they let the hot men write and wrangle, and for themſelves hear all, and ſee all, and ſay nothing. The truth is, while one ſide talks of Treaſon, and the other of Sacrilege, tis good to be wary. Tis not for private men to make an enemy either of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> and as the caſe ſtands you cannot ſay I, or No, without diſpleaſing one. I muſt confeſs I am very ſorry you would not let me play the Policitian for company. Your importunity has drawn me into the liſt of thoſe fools, who diſquiet themſelves to pleaſe other folks, and take a great deal of pains to be talk't on, twenty to one, very ſcurvily. The quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is betwixt ſupream Powers, and they beſt know what to do in their own concerns. I fear tis little better then ſawcines for men of our form to interpoſe in things ſo far above us, and perhaps madneſs, to thruſt in bewixt two ſtones, and be cruſht in pieces. I ſee this, yet cannot avoid whether the charms of your Friendſhip or violence of your importunity. Tis true I have endeavoured to touch this tender matter as tenderly as I could. What I profeſt at firſt, I repeat again, I do not dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize but relate, and am ſure you have no reaſon to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that I would diſpleaſe as few as I could. This is the reaſon, ſince you will needs have it, why I beat about the buſh, and do not ſhoot my fools-bolt directly at the mark, I do not take the ſatisfaction of your curioſity to import me ſo much as living quietly. Tis for Princes to reſolve on the <hi>Can not,</hi> or <hi>Shall not</hi> or what elſe they think fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Private men till they be commanded to declare them do beſt to keep their thoughts to themſelves. This I can aſſure you, that, though for theſe reaſons I do not deſire every body ſhould know them, I have none in this matter which do not become a good Chriſtian and a good ſubject, and</p>

                     <p>You tell me I may judge as I pleaſe. I know I may, and I do judge as all men of judgment do. But pray remember thoſe that do not plead directly <hi>Guilty, or not Guilty,</hi> caſt themſelves. Had I only deſir'd to know what people ſay, it had been no ſuch hard matter to have got Books, and read them my ſelf, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled you. I know the Arguments well enough, and I know what to think of them; but I know not what to think of you, whom a man that were not, as I am, very favourably inclin'd, would be apt to ſuſpect you think ſomething which you are aſham'd to own. No <hi>Friend!</hi> You ſcape not ſo. I would, and if you be not very obſtinate, will know what you are, and whether thoſe of your Religion may be truſted. If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is publickly written, and own'd by ſome among you, you are not; if you believe it not, but yet will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it; as honeſt as you are in your heart, ſince no body can tell but you are a knave, how can you expect but to paſs for one among the reſt? Either deal frankly with me, or I muſt with you, and tell you 'tis <hi>Guilt</hi> that fears the light. If you continue ſtill to make a ſecret, of what of all the world it moſt concerns thoſe of your Perſwaſion to publiſh, both for your own intereſt, and honour of your ſelves and Church, he muſt be a very good natur'd man who will think well of you, who make dainty to ſhew why he ſhould do ſo. You are charg'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence with Civil Government: You faintly deny it, and ſay you are traduc't, but are ſhy to juſtifie your Innocence. your Church it ſelf is call'd in queſtion, where the Books are licenc't, the Authors cheriſht, and the Doctrines put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. You tamely hear all this, and would have us think your Church a good Church for all that, a pure unblemiſh't Church: but, if we will not of our ſelves kindly turn away our eyes and look off, you will not do ſo much for her as wipe off thoſe blemiſhes.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true you have told me, and 'tis the only thing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have told me, that That cannot be the Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is openly diſclaim'd by a great part of the Church, and that part acknowledg'd Orthodox by all the reſt. But if your Chuch forbid any to profeſs their minds as freely
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:119"/> as others, it muſt needs be ſuſpected She has more kindneſs for theſe Doctrines than is for Her honour: and, however ſound ſhe may be, is yet a very injurious Church, which obliges her Subjects to paſs for ſuſpicious and dangerous people, and be thought to hold what they are not oblig'd to do, and what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they do not hold, but muſt not ſay ſo. Beſides, I have already told you the Caſe is not much different, whether theſe Doctrines belong to your Faith or not, if they be thought true; for that is enough to make them practic'd upon occaſion. And if your Church permit none to ſay they are falſe, who can think but ſhe deſires they ſhould paſs for true, and that they will do ſo at laſt if they do not already? And then truly we have great ſecurity from your Anſwer; as if, becauſe theſe Doctrines do not belong to your Church, as Church, they might not be made uſe of by your Church as ſo many men.</p>
                     <p>I told you this before, and you ſaw well enough how much your Churches reputation was concern'd, notwithſtanding what you ſay for her: and yet you continue cold, and will ſay no more. Never tell me. This Lethargy of yours is not for nothing. If you be grown careleſs of your own credit and intereſt, I thought nothing could have quench't the Zeal you all have of your Church. How! a Papiſt inſenſible when the Honour of his Church is in queſtion? Deny it as long as you will, either you are forbidden to ſpeak, and let people know what you harbour in your breaſts, or you harbour ſomething there which 'tis not for your intereſt people ſhould know. In ſhort, this conſtraint which is upon you muſt either be from abroad, or at home. You deny there is any from abroad: And I hope you ſay true; otherwiſe, I know not what to think of a Church which permits not her Subjects to approve their fidelity to their Prince. If it be at home, it can be nothing but Guilt, and ſhame, and the Conſcience of adhering to bad Tenets. For, I hope, you do not think in earneſt the State ſhould take it ill of any, who ſhould profeſs as openly as he will, that he is an honeſt man and a good Subject. If you fear nothing from your own ſide, it goes very ill with you if you have to fear from ours. We know who they are to whom the Civil-ſword is a Terrour.</p>

                     <p>Excuſe not your ſelf upon my curioſity, and think it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and unworthy of ſatisfaction. 'Tis true, I am curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and if I were not, you would make me ſo. But let me tell you, my curioſity is more a friend to you then your ſqueamiſhneſs. For, pray conſider, No Commonwealth, at leaſt none of a different Communion is ſafe, where thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are receiv'd, which are current among ſome of you. Who's the Friend? I, who give you occaſion, and preſs you to clear your ſelves? or you, who by your backwardneſs, will make it ſhortly be thought you cannot be clear'd? I know well enough, there is no great Community, nor can be, whoſe Members are all free from fault. The nature of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity bears not an abſolute perfection. But do you think it a ſmall point of friendſhip, that I offer you the means to make it appear, that whoever is faulty, you are not? Every body can tell, and were it put to your ſelf, I am fully perſwaded, you would not deny it, that he is not very well principled for a Subject, who believes what ſome of you teach. While you make ſuch a myſtery of it, no body can ſay you are not of the number, and many will ſuſpect you are. In fine, there is no choice; but either you do believe ill, and then I muſt change my good thoughts of you; or you do not, and then either ſay ſo plainly, or you are the moſt ſuperlative Politick in the world, to take other mens faults upon you, and entitle your ſelf to a guilt which is none of your own.</p>
                     <p>If you will give off the defence of your Church, and leave her to ſhift, as well as ſhe can, for her ſelf; why, with all my heart: I have no reaſon to wooe you to a ſenſe of your Churches reputation. If you will grow careleſs of your own fame, and be content to have it thought you deſerve the harſh cenſures which ſome make of you, you may too, if you pleaſe, though, as a Friend, I would adviſe you to do otherwiſe. But let me tell you, if you become forgetful, we ſhall not. We remember, there was ſuch a time as 88, and a thing call'd the Invincible <hi>Armada,</hi> and which might have been ſo indeed, if the Commanders had not been more careful to ſtick punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to their Orders, then do their buſineſs. We remember, the cauſe of all this was, what <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth cals Hereſie of the Queen, which mov'd him to expoſe the Kingdom as a prey, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second to ſeize it. We know this cauſe remains,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106994:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> and hope it will do ſo: If it have not wrought ſince, we may thank the want of opportunity, and proſpect of another <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada.</hi> But when occaſion ſerves, we cannot but think, the ſame cauſe will be apt to produce the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>Now, pray review your Politicks, and ſee whether they will counſel you to ſettle this opinion among your fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that in ſuch a caſe, which may happen, becauſe it hath happened, there are who would joyn with an enemy, and help to enſlave their Countrey; and that you are the men. If your Politicks do adviſe you to this, they are the worſt natur'd, unkindeſt Politicks in the world. I am ſure, let who will be the Politician, I am the Friend: But however they adviſe you, we, who are no Politicians, ſhould be glad to know there are none ſuch among us, or if there be, who they are. We va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue our own ſafety, though you do not your credit.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, if you will perſiſt in your Politick diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and think, we Hereticks are not to be truſted ſo far, as to be made acquainted that you are not errant Knaves, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it. But I will convince you, if I can, that there is ſomething more then bare curioſity in the matter. Let me tell you, in confidence, ſince this buſineſs muſt needs be made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that I am no ſuch ſtranger to it, as you think: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> thought of it a whole Moneth at leaſt, and am deceiv'd, if I do not ſee a little into the Milſtone. At leaſt, I am ſure, my eyes have one advantage, which, I ſuſpect, yours may want, that they are not dazled with the luſtre of great Names. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or if there be any of a more glorious ſound is no more to me then his reaſon, and at the hazard of being thought blunt, or raſh, or over-weening. I muſt needs avow to you, I am for the <hi>what's ſaid,</hi> and care little for <hi>who ſaid it.</hi> If every body were of my humor, I mainly ſuſpect, this Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Power, which makes ſo much ado, would have long ſince appeared neither better nor worſe then direct non-ſenſe. Pray let us conſider it a little.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether there be in the Pope an Indirect Power to depoſe Kings.</hi> He that would know, whether this be true or no, ſhould do well, in my opinion, to take along with him, what it means. 'Tis a Circumſtance, I muſt confeſs, which is oft forgot, and that forgetfulneſs, I believe, is the cauſe we find ſo much blind mans Buff in Books: But yet for once,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:121"/> it will not be amiſs to remember it. And becauſe every body knows what <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> means, likewiſe what 'tis to <hi>Depoſe,</hi> and what a <hi>King</hi> is, there is only this <hi>Indirect</hi> which needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridling. Now we often hear of Indirect dealing, and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſes in the world, and 'tis hard if people do not know what they mean. Indeed we are apt when we hear theſe words, to apprehend ſomething ſhameful or bad, becauſe there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſomething ſhameful joyned with them, fair ends being ordinarily fairly purſued. But yet ſhameful is not the notion of Indirect: For a good and commendable thing may be brought to paſs Indirectly, and if it be bad, the badneſs is one thing, and Indirectneſs another. The Merchant who met with Pirats in the dusk of the evening, when they could not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his weakneſs, and frighted them off by a counterfeit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, hanging out his lights all night, ſav'd his Ship indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or by indirect means, when direct fighting or flying had loſt it: And the Owner, I ſuppoſe, did not think this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directneſs blameable. A <hi>Nuncio</hi> of a certain place is reported to have publiſht an Excommunication, thought unjuſt by the perſons concern'd; they had no power to take off this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication themſelves, or command the <hi>Nuncio</hi> to do it. Wherefore they took an indirect courſe, and ſet Guards upon the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s Houſe, and ſuffered no Victuals to be brought in, till he thought it better to recal his Excommunication, then ſtarve. Theſe men too compaſt their end indirectly, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably, ſuppoſing the Excommunication was indeed unjuſt. When <hi>David</hi> cauſed <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to be ſlain, the action was both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and wicked, but yet for ſeveral reſpects: 'Twas wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it was the death of an innocent man, but indirect, becauſe he did not himſelf kill him, or command him to be kill'd, but ordered that out of which his death followed. Wherefore when we ſay, a thing is done indirectly, we mean, as I conceive, that ſomething is done, which we would, or could not do, by immediately endeavouring the thing it ſelf, but which follows from ſome other thing we do. And Indirect ſignifies, not directed immediately to that thing, in reſpect whereof 'tis called Indirect, but to ſome other, out of which what happens, whether by deſign or chance, we ſay, happens indirectly.</p>
                     <p>Now if this be the meaning of Indirect, I am ſomething at a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106994:121"/> loſs, how it can with propriety be apply'd to Power. For Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeems as direct to every effect as to any: Neither do I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how it can be directed otherwiſe, than by being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. When a man of the many things, he can do, reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, the power he has becomes, by that reſolution, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or directed to that one, which he chuſes; what other direction there can be of power occurs not to me at preſent. But if Indirect apply'd to Power ſignifie undetermin'd, there is plainly no room for the diſtinction of Direct and Indirect. For every Power is undetermin'd till it become determined; and when it is determined, it is direct, or directed, to that thing to which it is determined; neither can there be ſuch a thing as Indirect Power from which any thing can follow; for nothing can follow from a power undetermined, and Power from which nothing can follow is not Power. And the truth is, we do not give the name of Power to that which goes indire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to work. Not, but that the intended effect may follow, but we call it not Power in relation to ſuch an effect. We do not, nor can with truth ſay, a King has power to take away the lives of innocent Subjects, although he may, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> command them ſomething by which their Death may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. The Merchant ow'd his ſafety not to power, but ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem and luck: And thoſe who ſtarv'd the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> had no power to take off the Excommunication, on the contrary 'twas their want of power which made them act as they did. So that I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thoſe who firſt joyn'd theſe two words Indirect and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together, did not much amuſe themſelves with conſidering the import of them: Indirect ſeeming a kind of <hi>Deſtroying,</hi> or, as they call it, <hi>Alienating</hi> Term, and making the Power to be not-Power. Wherefore I believe 'tis Action, or Effect which is with propriety call'd Indirect, not Power. But, yet becauſe it matters not, ſo we underſtand one another, what words we uſe, Power to an Indirect effect may with ſence be called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct power. So a Prince who, to recover or preſerve his right, has direct power to make war, may be ſaid to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct power over his Subjects lives, which muſt be hazarded in the war. In this manner Indirect Power is intelligible, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Power to ſomething out of which follows another thing, which would not follow immediately from the Power it ſelf. This other thing may either be intended, as the Death of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:122"/> or not intended, as when one is ſlain in war whom the Prince is ſorry to looſe. And from this Intention comes Wickedneſs or Innocence, not Indirectneſs, which proceeds only from this, that the effect flows not immediately from the power, but is joyn'd to ſomething which does.</p>
                     <p>But now Indirect Power is become intelligible, let him make it intelligible that can, how the Depoſing Power, ſaid to be in the Pope, ſhould be Indirect. If he can command Depoſition, and muſt be obey'd when he commands, and the Prince depos'd by force of that command, his Power is as direct as Power can be. For when the Pope ſays, <hi>I Depoſe:</hi> I pray what is it which he commands? I underſtand he commands Depoſition it ſelf, and not another thing out of which he expects Depoſition ſhould follow. Again, when his command, as the luck on't is, it <hi>ſeldom</hi> does, proves effectual, and a King is depoſed: pray in vertue of what is he Depoſed? I underſtand 'tis in vertue of that command. Now, becauſe that Power is direct, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately commands an effect, which follows from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Power, there neither is nor can be any Indirectneſs found here, but in the very notion of Direct. So that I told you 'twas a ſcurvy thing to jabber words, and never mind what they ſignifie. For there is nothing in all this which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct power can mean, but Direct Power. In fine, there is no way to make this Power Indirect, but by ſaying either that the Pope, when he commands Depoſition, does not command De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which for my part I would not do, becauſe I fear I ſhould tell a lye: or elſe, that Depoſition does not follow from that from which it follows; and if I ſhould ſay this too, I fear I ſhould tell two lies. But however, ſince Indirect ſure muſt be ſome way oppoſite to Direct, The Popes Power to be Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect muſt be ſome way not directed to Depoſition. Which way this ſhould be, he muſt be wiſer than I that can tell. If Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or Intention would do it, ſure it cannot be thought he is not determin'd, or does not intend to do that which he commands. And if the Directneſs be taken, as it ought, from the immediate influence of the power upon the effect, we ſee he preciſely commands this particular effect, and 'tis maintained this effect muſt follow in vertue of that command. Now if any man can underſtand how a Power ſhould be Indirect in reſpect of an Effect to which it is directed all the ways by which Power
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106994:122"/> can be directed; I would gladly be directed to that man, to learn of him how nonſence may become ſence. But till I do meet him, I muſt needs think that this diſtinction of Direct and Indirect in this caſe, is a meer ſound of words which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, and by which the Authors ſpeculate themſelves into nonſence, and abuſe themſelves and their Readers.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that thoſe who maintain this Indirect Power ſpeak otherwiſe of it; but I think I ſpeak as all men, beſides themſelves, ſpeak, and know not by vvhat right they force upon vvords meanings proper to their purpoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what general cuſtom has fixt upon them. To alter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſetled Notions, is to perplex and embroyl things, and condemn the inquiries of men to hopeleſs and endleſs confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For Truth is diſcovered by ſeeing the connexion of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Notions are known by Words: and if the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to vvords remain not ſteady and unchanged, our ſearch after Truth muſt needs end in uncertain noiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable blunder. He who has the liberty to alter the notion of vvords, is empowred to maintain any thing. If he take a fancy to defend that <hi>Jet</hi> is vvhite, 'tis but by vvhite meaning black, and the buſineſs is done. Where I ſee Notions chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I am mighty ſuſpicious there is a deſign upon ſome Truth or other in the Changers. And ſo I fear it happens in our caſe. For if Indirect Power mean, according to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men, Power to an Indirect effect, Thoſe who will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Pope an Indirect Power muſt, to ſpeak ſence, ſay, that, though he has not immediately and properly Power to Depoſe, yet he has power to do ſomething out of which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition vvill follow. And this they vvould fain be at. For, give them their due, they are no enemies to ſence, vvhile ſence is no enemy to them. They offer therefore ſometimes at Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and vvould make us believe that from thence muſt follow Depoſition. Excommunication is vvithout doubt a proper effect of Spiritual Power, and ſo comes vvithin the ſphere of the Popes activity, and if it vvould but follow, that an Excommunicated Perſon can have no Communication no vvay, and vvith none; An Excommunicated Prince vvould by that means be Depoſed. For he could not govern thoſe vvith vvhom he could have no entercourſe, and if he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger govern, he vvere no longer King.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:123"/>
                     <p>This now is ſence, and intelligible; but the miſchief is, it will not do. They find Excommunication, when they conſider it a little better, hinders indeed Communion in Spirituals, but if there be any temporal tye to the Excommunicated perſon, as of a Wife to a Husband, a Servant to his Maſter, all Subjects to their Prince, Excommunication leaves this as entire and ſtrong as it was before. Any that has buſineſs with him, may deal with him notwithſtanding his Excommunication. For it would be fine, if, when an Excommunicated perſon ows me mony, I ſhould not require my debt of him becauſe he is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. Wherefore no Excommunication will hinder a Prince from converſing freely with his Subjects, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with him. Nay, they are obliged to all the acts of Duty to which they were before, and not to become faulty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if perhaps their Prince be ſo. Wherefore becauſe this will not hold water, they will not truſt to it, but think it ſafer to make bold with a word and give it a new notion, than ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the cauſe upon a foundation which they are conſcious will fail them. 'Tis a great deal better to talk a little non-ſence, than by obſtinately ſticking to ſence, hazard the loſs of a good Cauſe. That the Pope ſhall have power to depoſe Kings, come what will, they are reſolv'd. And becauſe the Canoniſts do not thrive very well with their extravagance of making him ſole and abſolute Monarch of the World, they think fit to be a little more modeſt, and allay the bold heat with ſprinckling this Indirect vpon it. But then the notion of that word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting what they cannot make good, there is no remedy but they muſt give it another. If they could have kept the ſence too, it would have been ſo much the better; but ſince that will not be, they think it at leaſt ſomething, if their Tenet, let it ſignifie what it will, ſound not altogether ſo harſhly as the Canoniſts, with which they perceive the World not very well pleas'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore applies this lenitive, and ſaies the Pope diſpoſes of Temporals only Indirectly: but whether he forgot the impertinent Circumſtance, or had any other reaſon, never tells us what that word means in his <hi>Rom. Pont.</hi> where he firſt uſes it, but leaving it to ſhift for it ſelf; and us to gueſs what it means, goes on to prove the power which he calls Indirect, never offering to ſhew that 'tis Indirect. Neither is there any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:123"/> mention, or uſe made of the word, that I perceive, in the whole courſe of his Arguments. So that 'tis manifeſt, <hi>Power</hi> was the thing for which he was concern'd: For the <hi>Indirect,</hi> he thought it no great matter what became of it, being perhaps in his own judgment but an inſignificant ſound, without influence upon the thing. Nevertheleſs againſt <hi>Barclay,</hi> when he had bethought himſelf, he kindly tells us what he means. <hi>The Popes Power,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is</hi> per ſe, <hi>and properly ſpiritual, and therefore has reference Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to ſpiritual matters as the primary object: but Indirectly, that is, in order to Spirituals, reductively, and by neceſſary conſequence, to uſe that phraſe, looks upon Temporals as a ſecundary object, to which it applys not it ſelf but upon occaſion,</hi> caſu <hi>or</hi> caſualiter, <hi>as the Canon ſpeaks.</hi> This is, if you will, conſequential, or reductive, or ſecondary, not Indirect Power. For I think all the world will ſay a King has very direct Power to make War, and yet he does it not but upon occaſion, and in order to peace, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his power to maintain peace, and eſtabliſh plenty, and ſecurity, and convenience, which is his primary object, and to which making war is by neceſſary conſequence reduc'd. But however 'tis a comfort to know what he means: And now we know what we talk of, let us a little conſider the import of the Thing, and leave the Terms, which if he will uſe improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I have not ſo much as indirect power to help it. 'Tis likely that to deal with words as he pleaſes, is not the only Priviledge of a Cardinal.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place then, I would fain know what real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence this word <hi>Indirect</hi> makes betwixt his opinion and the Canoniſts, which even he himſelf diſproves. And we will take the Canoniſts opinion, as he ſtates it himſelf:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De</hi> Rom. <hi>Font.</hi> l. 5. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Pope has by divine right most full power over the whole World, both in Eccleſiaſtical and Political matters.</hi> In this there are three particulars: That the Popes Power is moſt full; That 'tis in Political and Civil, as well as Spiritual matters; And that 'tis by Divine right. In one of theſe three he muſt diſagree with them, if he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree at all. Now his own opinion in his own Terms is: <hi>That the Pope, as Pope,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>has not directly and immediately any temporal, but only ſpiritual Power: but yet by reaſon of this ſpiritual Power, he has at leaſt Indirectly, a certain, and that higheſt</hi> (ſummam) <hi>Power in Temporals.</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:124"/> I am unſatisfi'd with more then one thing in this opinion, as you will perceive by and by. But for the preſent, I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an <hi>Oedipus,</hi> to unriddle to me the difference betwixt the two opinions. The Canoniſts ſay, the Popes Power is <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſima; Bellarmine</hi> ſays, <hi>Summa:</hi> They ſay, 'tis <hi>over Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals as well as Spirituals;</hi> he ſays, 'tis <hi>Spiritual, or over Spirituals,</hi> and <hi>over Temporals too.</hi> They ſay, 'tis by <hi>divine Right,</hi> and in this you may be ſure he will not quarrel with them; 'tis true, he forgot to expreſs it here, but he ſays it often enough elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. They ſay no more, and he ſays all this: Where is, or where can be the difference? Or ſhall we once in our lives find an example of things different, which differ in nothing? He puts indeed Direct and Immediate Power, as that which he would deny: But if he have rightly expreſt them, they mean by their Direct and Immediate, if any where they uſe thoſe terms no more then <hi>Pleniſſima,</hi> and he underſtood they meant no more: And if his <hi>Summa,</hi> do not ſay as much as their <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſima,</hi> take in Direct and Immediate and all, I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; neither can I think, but <hi>Summa</hi> will abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, or if it do not, they are very unſatiable men. At leaſt this is very clear, that all the difference he can pretend, muſt lye in this word, <hi>Indirectly:</hi> And this he tells us at laſt, imports reſpect to a ſecondary object. As if the Canoniſts ever deni'd Spirituals to be the primary object of the Popes Power, or cared a jot which was primary, and which ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, ſo he had full power over both.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe I do not love to ſee Friends fall out, I will anſwer for the Canoniſts for once, and engage they ſhall not quarrel with him for putting in a word more then they, as long as that word ſignifies but what they think as well as he. They are men who will hearken to reaſon, and not fall irreconcileably out with a man for expreſſing their mind in his own words. They have no quarrel to <hi>Secondarily,</hi> and will make none for calling this <hi>Secondarily</hi> by the name of <hi>Indirectly.</hi> Allow them but their <hi>Pleniſſima,</hi> and they ſhall keep the peace, I warrant them. Here is then no difference but only of a word, which they that uſe, and they that uſe not, both think the ſame. Sure <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was in a pleaſant humor, when he would go about to perſwade the world, that full Power in the Pope, is a great error, and contrary to Chriſtian Doctrine, if you call
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:124"/> this full Power <hi>Direct:</hi> But if you call it <hi>Indirect,</hi> then all's well, and Chriſtian Doctrine ſafe. And all this while Direct full Power is no more then moſt full Power, and Indirect no leſs. My Maſters! We had need have a care of our words. He that has the knack on't, may ſay unoffenſively, and make good Doctrine of that, which, if it be leſs luckily worded, may chance deſtroy the Law of Chriſt, and undo the world. What difference betwixt this, and <hi>Montulto</hi>'s <hi>Pouvoir prochain?</hi> And which of the two is the more ſerious trifler? And yet to ſee what a conceited world we live in! There are who make no difficulty to diſclaim the Canoniſts freely, and call their opinion extravagant and naught, and what you will: But propoſe the very ſame opinion to them, with no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the world then this inſignificant ſound, <hi>Indirectly;</hi> and as if there were charm in thoſe four ſyllables, they become preſently ſhy and myſterious, and will rather hazard to be ill thought of themſelves, then ſay what they think. I know a certain Gentleman, who writ to me not long ſince of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter, who, I think, was charm'd for company; but I name no body. Charms uſually laſt but to a certain time, and when the term is paſt, the man perhaps may recover.</p>
                     <p>But now I think on't better, 'tis good not to be too poſitive. Theſe <hi>Reductives,</hi> and <hi>Secondaries,</hi> and <hi>Conſequentials,</hi> are crabbed words, and I am a meer bungler at School-gibberiſh. I fear, it may be with that, as the Poet ſaid pleaſantly, of another ſort of canting; People muſt be mad before they can underſtand it. Subtle men ſay, there is a difference betwixt five, and two and three: And ſome ſuch difference, for ought I can anſwer, there may be here. The Pope may be ſaid in one opinion to look ſtraight forward, and in the other a ſquint upon Temporals, which is a difference, ſuch as it is, but which hinders not, but the ſquint-ey'd man may hit as ſurely and as ſtrongly as the other. Now becauſe I am not concern'd in the airy ſpeculations of your <hi>Ens-rationis-men,</hi> nor mean to be, I will not much ſtand with them for a Cobweb-difference or two, which may paſs with ſuch as are mad enough to underſtand it. But I look for a difference, which we dull men of the world may be able to conceive: A ſubſtantial and uſeful difference, by which it may appear, that whereas one opinion is naught and dangerous, the other is innocent and ſafe. I would ſee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:125"/> how your indirect men are better Subject then the other, and faſter to their Prince and their Duty: how they are leſs guilty of wrong, to the Soveraignty and Independence of Princes: in ſhort, how they are not as bad as thoſe who are direct Knaves. Theſe are the things, in which alone the world is concern'd: if the two opinions agree in theſe, let them differ in inconſiderable niceties, as much as they will; they are the ſame in danger, the ſame in inconſiſtency with Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that, if you remember, was the thing with which we began, and where, for ought I ſee, we ſtill ſtick. Till I ſee ſuch a difference, I muſt needs think all you have ſaid, no better then pure illuſion, and all you can ſay, till you ſay, where this difference is, will be but to talk learnedly from the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I muſt profeſs, I can find none: But becauſe I would be glad to learn of any body, I will entreat <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to tell me, what difference he finds, and what proviſion he makes, with his learned diſtinctions, for the Security of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Fidelity of Subjects. The firſt, which comes in my way, is in the ſtate of the Queſtion, <hi>That the Pope directly and immediately, hath not any temporal Power, but only ſpiritual; but indirectly at leaſt, in vertue of this ſpiritual Power, hath higheſt or ſoveraign Power over Temporals.</hi> And becauſe Directly's and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly's ſhould break no ſquares, he leaves them out againſt <hi>Barclay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> when he had a mind to ſpeak properly: <hi>When we ſpeak properly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we ſay, the Pope has Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in, or over Temporals, but not Temporal Power, as Pope.</hi> Now to acknowledge my ignorance, I muſt confeſs, I am quite gravel'd at very firſt, and cannot for my life, imagine, what kind of thing this only Spiritual, and not Temporal Power, ſhould be, which yet is higheſt or ſoveraign, even in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Without doubt, vve men of the vvorld are vvonderful ignorant things, and if vve but offer to underſtand any thing, theſe Scholars ſay, 'tis odds vve mar all. Who of our lovv form, but vvould have thought, that Povver over Temporals had been Temporal Povver? If I miſtake not, I have heard from ſome body, that had ſome acquaintance vvith theſe Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that Powers are ſpecifi'd by their Acts, which is indeed too high for me: It may be to purpoſe, and it may not. But I had verily thought, that who could do temporal things, had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:125"/> temporal power, and vvho could do ſpiritual things, ſpiritual. I was out it ſeems, and perceive now that properly ſpeaking 'tis otherwiſe. For all that, I cannot but think there is ſuch a thing as Temporal Power in the vvorld, and if Power in Temporals be not It, there remains nothing that I know, which can be It, but Power in Spirituals; and for the ſame reaſon Power in Temporals muſt be Spiritual Power; and ſo Kings, becauſe they have to do vvith Temporals, have in truth Spiritual Power; only vve ſpeak improperly in the vvorld, and call it Temporal. But this does not fadge neither. For then the Pope ſhould be ſaid to have Temporal power, for this proper reaſon, becauſe he has power in Spirituals.</p>
                     <p>Now I remember me there is a certain Pope vvho ſays, Kings have no Superior in Temporals.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Inno. 3. C.</hi> per Ven. Qui filii ſint legit.</note> This <hi>Barclay</hi> objected to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and he anſwers that by Superiour in Temporals, is meant a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Superior. Now I conſider not how vvell this anſwers <hi>Barclay.</hi> For let the Superiour be a temporal, or a ſpiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, ſo he be Superiour in Temporals, The King has a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in Temporals. But this is not to my purpoſe. I only obſerve that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> vvas of the mind, vvhen he vvrote this, that Superiour in Temporals was all one vvith Temporal Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. And then I ſee no reaſon in the vvorld, vvhy power in Temporals ſhould not alſo be all one vvith Temporal power. Certainly, ſince Power makes the Superiour, there is as much <hi>ſympathy</hi> betwixt the Superiour and the Power as this comes too.</p>
                     <p>But in the name of vvonder, vvhat does Power in Temporals ſignifie, and vvhat Temporal Power? <hi>Bellarmin</hi> means the Pope may by his power in Temporals diſpoſe of the temporal thing call'd a Kingdom. The Canoniſts mean ſome ſuch thing by their Temporal Power. By this account both ſignifie power to diſpoſe of Temporals, and methinks 'tis no ſuch mortal quarrel vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a dog muſt be ſaid to be beaten vvith a ſtick or a ſtaff. Or, are they perhaps mere ſounds, to vvhich belongs no ſence, but vvhat they give them as they find convenient for their purpoſe; and ſo vvhen vve are askt vvhat <hi>Temporal,</hi> or what <hi>in Temporals</hi> ſignifies, we muſt anſwer vvith <hi>Montalto, What you pleaſe Father?</hi> Never believe me if I can make more of this <hi>in Temporals,</hi> then an Inchanted Caſtle vvhich houſes and entertains the Knight as long as he has uſe of it, and as ſoon as he is gone vaniſhes into a pure Temporal Inn. Which way ſoever I turn me, I am quite at a loſs; ſo that I think 'tis beſt to give it over, and let <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:126"/> alone vvith his <hi>power over Temporals,</hi> and <hi>no Temporal Power;</hi> and ſpeak to you in a language vvhich both of us underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Do you in earneſt believe there is any ſuch difference betwixt theſe two, that the one makes a good, the other a bad Subject? And that a King is ſafe enough as long as his Subjects ſpeak properly. Marry, if their language once become leſs exact, then let him look to himſelf. Good School-maſters are the only Guards if this be true. I am afraid to meddle vvith <hi>Bellarmin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for vvhether I ſay I, or no, 'tis odds, but I ſhall be out ſtill. But yet I gueſs he meant his Power in Temporals is truly Power. If it be true Power, ſure there is true obedience due to it. And if all Chriſtians are bound to obey him in Temporals, Kings can have no Subjects but Infidels, unleſs to be even with the Pope, they fall to commanding in Spirituals. For if they can command in nothing, I do not ſee how they are Kings. But this is but ſhifting ſides, and leaves us ſtill vvhere vve vvere. Let <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> ſay vvhat he vvill; He vvho has power to command is to be obey'd; if the Pope can command in Temporals, I muſt obey him in Temporals: And he vvhom I muſt obey in Temporals, is my King and no body elſe. So that the Pope is univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch vvithout more ado, and there is no King in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf. For 'tis not the proper name of Power, but Power which does the buſineſs. Call it how you vvill, properly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, if there be a Power in the vvorld vvhich Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt acknowledge, and ſubmit their Crowns, and leave their Kingdoms vvhen this Power requires them, They are not Kings, I mean, Soveraigns of vvhom vve only ſpeak. And they vvere mightily out vvho ſaid Princes vvere <hi>ſolo Deo minores,</hi> that they vvere accountable only to him, and had none elſe above them, and twenty other ſuch untrue things. For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has found one that is above them, and I fear above God too: at leaſt he can take away vvhat God gave, vvhich is to make a little too bold vvith him.</p>
                     <p>But I am out again, as I fore-ſaw I ſhould be. All this, ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> follows from the vvicked direct Temporal Power of the Canoniſts, not from my innocent Indirect power over Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals. I told you there vvas no medling vvith Schollers. While vve keep vvithin our own verge, vve may happily light upon a little indirect ſence, vvhich may ſerve turn, and do vvell enough among our ſelves: but if vve go beyond our bounds, and tread the forbidden paths of Schollerſhip, it turns preſently direct non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I verily thought this had follow'd! But it ſeems it does not.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:126"/> 
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has ſtopt the Carrier with a Diſtinction, which for fear of miſtakes you ſhall have in his own words. <hi>If,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adver.</hi> Barc. c. 5.</note> ſaies he, <hi>there were in the Pope Spiritual and Temporal power directly, and he were King of the World, as he is Biſhop of the univerſal Church, and other Kings did but meerly execute temporal Jurisdiction; truly the Pope might at his pleaſure deprive whatſoever Kings of the adminiſtration and execution of temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and by this means take away Civil government, or confound it with the Eccleſiaſtical; and would be greater then Christ, becauſe he could take away Powers which he willed ſhould be, and be diſtinct.</hi> Theſe now to my apprehenſion are naughty things, and the opinion, out of which they follow, a naughty opinion. And I muſt needs commend <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for chuſing another, out of vvhich it may not follow, that Popes at their pleaſure may deprive any King of the execution of temporal Juriſdiction, and take away Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be greater than Chriſt. This, you ſee, is vvhat he ſaies follows from the other opinion, and vvhat he makes us expect does not follow from his. Let us hearken then to what he ſaies of it, and underſtand it if vve can. <hi>But,</hi> goes he on, <hi>if we put in the Pope only Spiritual power Directly, and Temporal Indirectly, that is only in order to Spirituals, it does not follow that the Pope can take away, or confound Civil government.</hi> Once in my life I was in the right. This is what I thought was not to follow. What is that which does then? Why, <hi>It follows only,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that the Pope by his Spiritual and Apoſtolic moſt eminent Power can direct and correct the Civil Power, and if it be needful, to the Spiritual end take it away from one Prince, and give it to another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pray aſſiſt me a little, for I am in again as deep, as juſt now with in Temporals not Temporal. Was not this taking away Civil power the thing vvhich he ſaid did not follow from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and does he not now ſay it does? Or have I rendred him amiſs? Let me ſee: his own words are; <hi>non ſequitur poſſe tollere— ſed ſolum ſequitur poſſe adimere.</hi> O! 'tis <hi>tollere</hi> which does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and only <hi>adimere</hi> vvhich follows. And here's a plain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for one vvord has four ſyllables, and the other but three. The miſchief is, thoſe who underſtand not Latin will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find it, and I hardly know how to help them. For whether it be that Latin be the more proper language for diſtinctions, or that he be better at Latin, then I at Engliſh, I am puzled to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: And yet I have conſulted my Dictionary, but there is but one Engliſh word, <hi>to take away,</hi> for both. But methinks it ſounds ſcurvily to ſay, it does not follow <hi>he can take away,</hi> but it does fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:127"/> 
                        <hi>he can take away.</hi> That looks like ſaying and unſaying, giving and taking, vvhich is Childrens play. To make ſome difference then, we muſt ſay, It does not follow he can <hi>take away,</hi> but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows he can <hi>away-take:</hi> which, though it be to force the language a little, yet 'tis better to make bold vvith that, then ſpoil the ſence, and make no diſtinction at all. Princes then were in a ſad caſe if the wicked doctrine of the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> were true, that their Kingdoms may <hi>be taken away,</hi> but as long as they may only be <hi>away-taken,</hi> all's vvell enough.</p>
                     <p>But yet this is not well neither. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> loves to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and this <hi>away-take</hi> perhaps would not pleaſe him; as indeed it has but an odd ſound. To be then both juſt to him, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to our language, we vvill put it thus: It does not follow he can take away Civil power vvith a vvord of three ſyllables, it only follows he can take it away with a word of four. This is true Engliſh, and a true difference. For one kills <hi>on Tierce,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>en Quart,</hi> which though they may happen from the ſame hand, and the ſame ſword, are yet diſtinct killings. And ſo thanks to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> we have maſter'd a deep point of learning, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Canoniſts opinion is a very wicked opinion, becauſe it expoſes a Prince to the villanous thruſt <hi>en Tierce,</hi> but <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s very innocent, vvhich laies him open only to the fair <hi>en Quart.</hi> Now you may judge with your infallible judgment as you pleaſe, but I muſt needs think that to take away, with a word of 4, or if you will 40 ſyllables, is to take away, and to hit <hi>en Quart</hi> is to hit; and if any judge theſe things may be practic'd upon our ſacred Soveraign; I muſt farther think, and plainly tell you he deſerves to be confuted by Judge and Executioner too.</p>
                     <p>But ſtay! May not <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſay perhaps, that to take away Civil Power from one Prince, and give it to another, is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to take away Civil Power, but only to tranſlate it; ſince the Power remains, only put into other hands. Truly he may ſay this for ought I know, and twenty other things, of which I ſhall never dream. But I think he could not mean it in this place. For here he intends to ſpeak contrary to the <hi>Canoniſts:</hi> and, as mad as they are, I believe there is none among them ſo ſenſleſs to ſay or think, that Civil power can abſolutely be taken away out of the vvorld, by the moſt direct and unlimited Power that is or can be. They know vvell enough there muſt be Civil Power as long as there is Civil Government, and there muſt be Civil government as long as there be Cities and Men. So that Civil Power can no more, nor ſooner be taken out of the vvorld then Mankind. For
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:127"/> ſhould the Pope take all Power into his own hands, and appoint Lieutenants here and there, where he could not be in perſon, theſe Lieutenants muſt of neceſſity have and exerciſe Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even though they were Churchmen; As the Pope himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually does. For when in his own Territories he puniſhes Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors for civil Crimes, he does not do this in vertue of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power, but as a Temporal Prince, as one that has Civil power as well as Eccleſiaſtical. Wherefore I conceive <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cannot ſay he meant his taking away Power, of taking it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely out of the vvorld, taking from one and giving to another being not to take away Power it ſelf, but to tranſlate it; becauſe there is no vvay by vvhich Civil Power can be taken away, but only by tranſlating; nevertheleſs, if he did, as this is not the firſt time he has ſaid vvhat he had no great reaſon to ſay, I muſt tell him, that this tranſlating is every jot as unſatisfactory to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis every jot as unſafe to our Soveraign, as plain taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For if it be taken away from him, vvhoever has it next, 'tis taken away from him. And vvhoever holds this may be done, let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeak never ſo ſubtly, I muſt hold is no good Subject.</p>
                     <p>There is another diſtinction or two, or explication, or vvhat you vvill call them vvhich ſtick in my ſtomach. To underſtand them the better, it vvill be convenient to mention the occaſion he had to make them. <hi>Barclay</hi> in his 12th. Chapter objected againſt his opinion, that it makes Chriſtian Princes Vaſſals to the Pope, and hold their Kingdoms only at pleaſure, or precariouſly. And this he proves by this Argument: <hi>The Pope if it be neceſſary for the good of Souls may take away a Kingdom from one Prince, and give it to another; but to Judge and decree whether it be neceſſary or no, belongs to the Pope, and none muſt judge whether his Sentence be right or wrong; Therefore he may at pleaſure Dethrone the one and Crown the other.</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin Anſwers, that <hi>Chriſtian Princes must by no means be call'd the Popes Vaſſals, and much leſs be ſaid to hold their Kingdoms at pleaſure, But are true Kings, and true Princes.</hi> This goes well; but yet if his opinion make them Vaſſals, I hope they may without offence to it be call'd ſo. But however Princes are to thank him for this confeſſion that they are true Kings and Princes, and may hope ſo much may, for his ſake, paſs for true doctrine: Which if it once do, there is ſo much true fidelity due to thoſe true Kings, that what takes it but indirectly away, will be found directly falſe.</p>
                     <p>Coming then to ſpeak to <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Argument, he ſays 'tis faulty every where, <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> and all. Still there is no medling with Schollers. Theſe two premiſes of <hi>Barclay</hi> are two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:128"/> which he has borrowed from <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, and were very good Propoſitions, as long as he had the handling of them; but as ſoon as ever another but breaths on them, they fade and wither to non-ſence; and yet I perceive no alteration in them, but that before they came out of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> mouth, and now out of <hi>Barclays.</hi> However he tells us, This Propoſition, <hi>The Pope may, if it be neceſſary for the good of Souls, take away a Kingdom from one, and give it to another; needs explication: for it may be well, and ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; it may be true, and it may be falſe.</hi> I make no queſtion but it may be, and is falſe: but I would fain ſee the Explication by which it may be true. This it is: <hi>The Pope indeed may, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of Souls, take the Kingdom from one; but, if he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him before, if he give him time to repent, if he find him pernicious and incorrigible.</hi> May he ſo? Why then your opinion, for all your <hi>Buts,</hi> and <hi>Ifs,</hi> is pernicious, and you incorrigible, good <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> What's this to ſay, but that he cannot ſteal his Kingdom in the dark, but may rob him of it in broad day light? This Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Space of Repentance is in other words: The Pope muſt firſt ſay to the King; look you, I deal fairly above-board, and give you notice before hand, that if you do not do as I would have you within ſuch a time, it may be a month or two, it may be ſo many hours (for this ſpace of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s is for ought I ſee, at the Popes appointing too) I will turn you a grazing, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my good people another King.</p>
                     <p>I ſee no ſuch matter of ſubſtance in theſe formalities, but that they might be well enough ſpar'd, if conveniently they could. But they are a ſort of impudent things, which will thruſt in whether the Pope will or no. For Kingdoms are no ſuch inconſiderable trifles, that they can be paſſ'd away in private, and none know when or how. Except King <hi>Phys</hi> and King <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſh,</hi> none ever yet ſtept into another mans Throne without warning, and I believe, none ever will. Does <hi>Bellarmine</hi> think it can happen in the world, that there ſhould be a King ſo tame, that without more knowledge of the matter, as ſoon as a ſentence of Depoſition is brought, ſhould quietly ſubmit, and turn private man, and enquire no farther. Kings are more inquiſitive then ſo, and ſtand more upon their terms, and look to be better ſatisfi'd. And though they did not, Subjects who have ſworn Fealty, have a little curioſity in them, and will be asking why, and by what neceſſity they muſt change Lords, and obey <hi>Peter,</hi> who have ſworn to <hi>Paul.</hi> There goes time to all this, for nothing will come of it till all parties be agreed. Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> requires no more to make his ſentence juſt, nor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:128"/> ſo much, as nature will force upon him, let it be never ſo unjuſt. Of neceſſity there muſt intervene more time in the change of Kings, then he requires to his admonition and ſpace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So that his Explication amounts in ſhort to this: The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence were unjuſt, if it requir'd things ſhould paſs in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which 'tis impoſſible they ſhould paſs; but very juſt, if things be ſo done, as they muſt be done, in ſpite of ſentence, or whatever elſe to the contrary; which is certainly a very trim Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and alters the Propoſition wonderfully for the better. We cannot put ſo much as a Tenant out, without warning, and he would perſwade us, we are much beholding to his Explication, for requiring as much Ceremony in the change of a Kingdom, as a Farm.</p>
                     <p>And yet when all is done, I cannot tell whether he be in earneſt or no, and think theſe Formalities ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary, that a King cannot be depos'd without them. It is hard to ſay, what Plenitude of Power may do, and I doubt, he would not be well look't on, who ſhould go about to fix its bounds. But beſides that, a Caſe may happen, where a King cannot repent, though he would, or at leaſt, make amends by repentance: A Caſe may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, where he will not repent, nor believe he hath reaſon ſo to do. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would perſwade us, <hi>Ozias</hi> in the Old Law was depos'd for Leproſie. What! did the High Prieſt admoniſh him to repent of his Leproſie, and not proceed to Depoſition, till after conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent patience with him, he found him incorrigible in his Leproſie? <hi>Ozias</hi> might, and 'tis likely did repent the fault for which he was ſtruck with Leproſie, but unleſs his repentance could make him clean again, as to the matter of Depoſition, he had as good ne'r repented at all; for he vvas, according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> depos'd, for vvhat no repentance could cure. Again, in the Nevv Lavv, he vvould make us believe, <hi>Chilperick</hi> vvas depos'd for inſufficiency. Did the Pope admoniſh him to repent the grievous fault of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo little vvit, and allovv him time to provide himſelf of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brains, and better organs, and vvhen he found him incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and all perſvvaſion loſt upon him, and that, ſay the Pope vvhat he could, he vvould not do vvhat he could not do, then at laſt after fruitleſs and long deluded patience caſt him off? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> do require ſuch Formalities as cannot conveniently be ſpared, yet poſſibly he may not think their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſo abſolute, as that the Depoſition ſhould be void if they concur not. But let him think vvhat he pleaſes, vvhile vvith all his inſignificant Buts, he preſerves this ſubſtance, that a King may be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:129"/> depoſed, if inſtead of three, be require three hundred Ceremonies, the opinion is ſtill inconſiſtent vvith Civil Government. And for our Caſe in particular, our Soveraign does not think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vvhat <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cals Hereſie and a depoſing fault, for this reaſon, becauſe he does not think it a fault, and is for that reaſon very like to be incorrigible in it too; and vvhoever thinks he may therefore be depoſed, is himſelf pernicious, and not to be endured in his Dominions.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much for the taking avvay <hi>But.</hi> For the giving <hi>But,</hi> he tels us, <hi>The Pope may alſo give the Kingdom to another, yet not at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to whom he thinks fit, for ſo indeed Kings were but precarious Kings. But He is ty'd to the order of Juſtice, whether Succeſſion or Election take place, or if there be none can claim, then to him whom reaſon profers.</hi> I fear the truth of this may be queſtioned. Sure I am that vvhen Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> vvas depoſed, and her Kingdom given to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> there vvere better Titles afoot in the vvorld, then K. <hi>Philips.</hi> Thanks be to God, the Throne of <hi>England</hi> has not been vacant, and the Popes reaſon never troubled to fill it. When Kingdoms are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to prey, 'tis catch that catch can. I ſee no great order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in that. But ſuppoſe it vvere true, vvhat ſignifies this order of Juſtice? and vvhat bar to the Popes pleaſure in Succeſſion or Election? If the next Heir, or next Elect be a man, vvho pleaſes not the Pope, I ſuppoſe he muſt be paſſ'd by, and ſo as many as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, till they come at laſt to ſome body who is <hi>rectus in Curiâ.</hi> For the firſt might ſtand as vvell as any of theſe, vvho, I conceive, are all in the number of thoſe vvho cannot claim; and then vvhat does Succeſſion or Election hinder, but the Pope ſtill gives at pleaſure, ſince none ſhall ſucceed or be elected, but vvhom he pleaſes? Again, vvhat difference betvvixt giving a Kingdom to vvhom the Pope pleaſes, and to vvhom Reaſon, meaning the Popes Reaſon, prefers? Preference of Reaſon is nothing in the vvorld, but that the Pope pleaſes to think it fitter this man ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, then the other. So that <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are nothing in truth but the <hi>Popes Pleaſure,</hi> and all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affords us, is a meer ſound of vvords vvhich ſignifie nothing, and if they did, vvere nothing to purpoſe neither. For vve are all this vvhile beſide the Cuſhion.</p>
                     <p>It makes nothing, I think, to the juſtification of a Robbery, that the prey vvas equally ſhared; and vvhen a King is dethroned, he is as much dethroned, if he be ſucceeded by the next heir as by a ſtranger, neither do I believe, he is much concern'd vvho comes next upon the Stage, vvhen his ovvn part is ended. Our Queſtion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:129"/> at Preſent is, whether Kings in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> doctrine be only precarious Kings. By the way Precarious is not very currant <hi>Engliſh;</hi> I think we ſhould call it holding at will, or pleaſure, or if you will coyn a new word, Tenure by Intreaty. But however let us keep our Authors word. <hi>Barclay</hi> objects that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes Kings precarious, becauſe he allows the Pope to take away and give Kingdoms, and this whenever he has a mind, as being ſole judge in the caſe. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> anſwers, that Kings were indeed Precarious, if their Kingdoms could be diſpos'd of at pleaſure, but becauſe the Pope is ty'd to the order of Juſtice in that point, they are not precarious. As if <hi>Barclay</hi> inſiſted on that, or thought their being Precarious depended on that diſpoſition. The Son in defence of his Father laughs at that notion of Precarious, and rightly obſerves that Precarious is not ſaid with relation to him that gives, but him that takes away. 'Tis the power of revocation, if that word fit him vvho never gave, plac'd in the Pope, the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing when the Pope thinks fit, which makes a King precarious, let the Kingdom be diſpos'd how 'twill afterwards, the King is ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, purely Tenant at vvill.</p>
                     <p>But pray tell me truly. Do you in earneſt find any thing in theſe healing <hi>Buts</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> which makes his opinion a jot ſounder then the <hi>Canoniſts;</hi> a jot ſafer for Princes, or more dutiful for Subjects? For my part I profeſs ſeriouſly I find nothing, unleſs non-ſence will do the feat. There is a little more non-ſence in this opinion then the other, and if that be a ſecurity for Princes, it would do vvell if the vvorld ran mad as faſt as it could. While men are in their wits, they vvill go near to think never a Barrel better Herring.</p>
                     <p>Juſt ſuch work he makes vvith <hi>Barclays</hi> next Propoſition, which was this: <hi>To judge, when 'tis neceſſary for the good of Souls, that a King be depos'd, belongs only to the Pope, and none is to queſtion his Judgment.</hi> This he ſaies is like the former, and if it be ill underſtood, is falſe, but rightly underſtood is true, but then concludes not what <hi>Barclay</hi> would have it. Now am I terribly afraid that <hi>ill underſtood</hi> is as much in <hi>Bellarmins</hi> language, as <hi>truly underſtood,</hi> or ſo as it truly ſignifies, and <hi>rightly underſtood</hi> means <hi>underſtood otherwiſe then as it ſignifies.</hi> For elſe I cannot for my heart ſee but if the Pope may depoſe when there is neceſſity, and judge when this neceſſity happens, and none muſt call his judgment in queſtion, and theſe words mean as they ſound, Kings are purely Tenants at will, and the Pope may depoſe them whenever he pleaſes to judge it neceſſary, which is what <hi>Barclay</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. What is the good meaning in which vve muſt rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it? Why, <hi>It does indeed belong to the Pope,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>to judge whether it be neceſſary a King ſhould be depriv'd of his Kingdom.</hi> Very well! So <hi>Barclay</hi> underſtood it, and ſo <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf underſtands it. Why
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:130"/> does it not conclude then, that Princes may be depos'd at pleaſure? Becauſe of another <hi>But. But,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>it does not belong to the Pope to feign neceſſities at pleaſure, or ſerve his paſſions under pretence of neceſſity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is as unlucky it his Buts, as Diſtinctions. Whoever ſaid it belong'd to the Pope to feign neceſſities? and yet it may be ſaid as truly as that Depoſing belongs to him. If <hi>Bellarmin</hi> could give good ſecurity the Pope ſhould never do more then belong'd to him, there might be ſomething in it: but if that were ſo, we ſhould not have heard ſo much of this Depoſing power, for that does not belong to him neither. But belong, or not belong, he may feign a neceſſity by paſſion, or he may judge that neceſſary which is not ſo by miſtake; and if he does ſo, 'tis all one as if he did not feign, and not miſtake, when neither Prince, nor any body elſe, is allow'd to judge whether he feign or no. Unleſs the Pope be ſuppoſed infallible in ſincerity too, and that he will alwaies declare, This man I depoſe upon a true, and that upon a feigned neceſſity. But if we muſt take all he ſaies is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to be truly neceſſary, Kings may be depos'd at pleaſure, for he may ſay ſo when he pleaſes. Marry if other people muſt ſee this neceſſity as well as himſelf; all good ſubjects will tell him there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nor can be any neceſſity why a King ſhould be depos'd. <hi>I,</hi> but, ſaies <hi>Bellarmin, becauſe this is a matter of great importance, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt be manifeſt and ſeen, therefore Popes ordinarily do theſe things in Synods of Biſhops, or Conſiſtories of Cardinals, ſhewing his reaſons and taking their conſents.</hi> Yes ſure,'tis a matter of great importance, too great to be thus trifled with. Manifeſt quotha! I beſeech you to whom muſt this neceſſity be manifeſt? If to any beſides himſelf; why 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all good Subjects, that there neither is, nor ever was, nor ever ſhall or can be any ſuch neceſſity, and 'tis manifeſt they are not good Subjects who think otherwiſe. But if He alone be Judge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt as well as the neceſſary, his command without more ado is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough that 'tis manifeſt to Him, it ought be commanded. And I hope he can as eaſily and as ſoon ſay <hi>'Tis manifeſt,</hi> as <hi>'Tis neceſſary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then for his <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtories,</hi> I wonder what they are for. Does he conſult with them, tro, whether that be to be done of which there is a neceſſity, and this neceſſity ſeen and manifeſt? He may conſult the <hi>How,</hi> but the <hi>Whether</hi> is a wiſe point of conſultation, if it be already manifeſt. Or is it perhaps to be made manifeſt by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation? If ſo, the caſe is not ſo clear as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pretends, and other perſons, more concern'd then his Synods and Conſiſtories, have reaſon to expect it ſhould be made manifeſt to them too, as well as the other. Beſides, He who makes what Biſhops and Cardinals he pleaſes, and of ſuch as he makes conſults with whom he pleaſes, has wit enough ſure to chuſe ſuch, of whom he may be certain before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:130"/> they will oppoſe nothing which he ſhall propoſe. Indeed if by his Synods he meant General Councels, there might be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. The Biſhops of The Prince concern'd, and of thoſe Princes who were leagu'd with him, would go neer to ſpeak in his behalf. Elſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in his language imports no more then a company of Biſhops, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not ſo much, choſen according to the Popes pleaſure. And yet even thus much is more then he thinks neceſſary too. He ſaies the Pope ordinarily does thus, but if he will do otherwiſe, He may for any thing <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaies to the contrary. And the truth is 'tis not to be expected but he will. To depoſe a King is not every daies work. 'Tis an extraordinary caſe, and in extraordinary caſes there may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary proceedings. However the Pope is ſtill Judge of this, as of all the reſt, and ſo when all is done we are purely at the Popes pleaſure for all.</p>
                     <p>There is a brace more of Volunteers, which though they be reſolute enough, and venture on any thing, let it be never ſo deſperate, and let them have never ſo little to do with it, yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpares them as much as he can, and keeps them in reſerve for dead-lifts, and then, which often happens, they never fail him. One is <hi>De Facto,</hi> and <hi>De Jure.</hi> This is a diſtinction good enough in it ſelf, but as he uſes it only at a pinch, and when he has nothing elſe to ſay, it looks ſtill like a piece of good ſtuff hung in a place which it will not fit. For example, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> writing of a certain Law, which for his own part he diſlik't, and thought unjuſt, but yet publiſht, as he was commanded by the Emperour; ſpeaks thus: <hi>I being ſubject to your command, have cauſed the Law to be ſent into ſeveral parts, and becauſe the Law agrees not with God Omnipotent, I have by my Letter informed my Serene Lords. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have in both done what I ought, obey'd the Emperour, and not conceal'd what I thought for God.</hi> Now I ſhould think that to publiſh an unjuſt Law, and where the Injuſtice concern'd the ſervice of God and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Church, as was here the caſe, without the excuſe which bears out a Subject, who is not to examine but obey the commands of his Superiour, is to do an unjuſt thing, and for which now adaies Force would hardly paſs for an excuſe. If any encroachment be thought made upon the Church in our times, the language is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I will die first, I will ſuffer Martyrdom, before the Cauſe of God, and Eccleſiaſtical immunity ſhall ſuffer by my means.</hi> I take this Pope to have been a man of as much zeal as thoſe who uſe this language, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be ſo, and ſince he ſubmitted to a bare command, he either thought that command had power to oblige him, or he acted againſt his Conſcience without obligation. Wherefore plainly he thought himſelf <hi>De Jure</hi> ſubject, or <hi>De facto</hi> he did very ill.</p>
                     <p>For all that, <hi>I,</hi> ſays <hi>Bellarmin, ſay this obedience was forc't, de Facto,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:131"/> not de Jure.</hi> Why then I think you may ſay any thing. Pray conſider again good <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Does not he ſay, he did but what he ought? <hi>

Sure as can be a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal may do what he pleaſes. If he will have words ſignifie otherwiſe then they do, there is no conteſting. Otherwiſe, if the Pope were ſubject <hi>de Facto</hi> only, not <hi>de Jure,</hi> the Emperour had no Right to command him, and if the Emperour had no Right to command, the Pope had no obligation to obey, and then he ought have done quite the contrary (for Force is no excuſe for injuſtice) and what <hi>I ought</hi> ſignifies what <hi>I ought not,</hi> which we dull men ſhould never have ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Allow us but the ſame liberty though, and it ſhall be ſhamfully hard for which we will not make a ſhift to ſay ſome thing. That Chalk is blew, for example, which we will ſay is white only <hi>de Facto,</hi> but blew <hi>de Jure.</hi> That the Fire burns <hi>de Facto,</hi> but only warms <hi>de Jure.</hi> That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is a great Scholler <hi>de Facto,</hi> but <hi>de Jure</hi> none at all. I know I ſpeak impertinently, but I meant to do ſo, and yet think I ſpeak as pertinently as he who ſaies Duty is only duty <hi>de Facto,</hi> but <hi>de Jure</hi> not duty. He might ee'n as well have made uſe of his <hi>Indirect</hi> here too, and ſaid the Pope was ſubject only <hi>Indirectly,</hi> but was not ſubject <hi>Directly,</hi> or contrariwiſe, for 'tis all one. Young Sophiſters ſometimes when they are put to it, and, know not how to ſhift off an Argument, find ſomething or other which ſounds like a diſtinction, no matter what it ſignifies, and whether any thing or nothing, ſo it ſerve turn for the preſent, And I doubt he remembred the trick a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too long.</p>
                     <p>But Subjection to Princes being prov'd by Examples, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, This is the Reſerve for Examples, when they are ill-natur'd, and will not be turn'd off otherwiſe. For Commands there is another common place, which now 'tis known is nothing, but he was a very ſubtle man lure that firſt diſcovered it. It conſiſts in diſtinguiſhing the ſame man into a Prince, and a not-Prince, and then interpreting all obedience we find commanded, belongs to the Prince only, the not-Prince has no ſhare in it. This diſtinction, becauſe it is indeed a little hard, they attribute to the Omnipotent power of the Pope; and ſay that the Prince, till he be depoſed, is a Prince, but afterwards no Prince; and becauſe it ſtill falls ſhort, for the man governs and lives like a Prince ſtill, they etch it out with its fellow diſtinction, and ſay he is no Prince <hi>de Jure,</hi> though he be <hi>de Facto.</hi> And now bring 'em as many and as plain places for obedience as you will, 'tis the eaſieſt thing in the world to get cleer of them; Bring Scripture, bring Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that a Prince is to be obey'd; True, ſay they, while he is a Prince, but now he is no longer a Prince.</p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:131"/>
                     <p>Princes in my opinion have hard luck to ſtand in the Popes way, and become the firſt ſad examples of his Omnipotence: otherwiſe there is no Law of God or Man which may not be overturn'd as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily by the ſame engine. For he may as ſoon and as well declare, That Wife to be no Wife, That Man to be no Man, and make Adultery and Murther lawful, as that King to be no King, and make Rebellion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. There would not want as likely pretences for the one as the other, if people would but look after them. For Example, A Man is a rational Creature, who acts unreaſonably diſclaims his nature, and may be diſpatch't without contradicting the Divine Law, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids men to be kill'd while they are men, but he by the Popes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is no man. As much may be found out for the Wife, as much for Eſtates, as much for every thing. For there neither is nor can be any ſtronger title to any thing then the Law of God, and that the King has to his Kingdom, and if that will not do, nothing will. This is juſt <hi>Montalto.</hi> Sin but enough and you trapan the Devil, and become vertuous even by being wicked. To refuſe obedience to a King is with them a crime, and a crime which deſerves damnation; marry to Un-king him, and deny there is any obedience due to him, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent thing. As if taking his Power quite away, were not a greater diſobedience then to reſiſt it. A particular diſobedience may have a particular, and ſometimes excuſable cauſe; but a general diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſuch as leaves them no longer any Power to command, is of all diſobedience the greateſt, moſt inexcuſable in it ſelf, and moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Divine Law. And yet he would perſwade us, we ſin, if we obey not a particular, perhaps trifling Command, but if we take away Power and all, we are very honeſt men. Whereas in truth, when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey a Power which I acknowledge, perhaps I wrong my ſelf moſt, for I do not my duty; but when I no longer acknowledge my Princes Power, I do him as well as my ſelf the greateſt wrong I can; and yet this greateſt wrong with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is no wrong.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the healing Diſtinctions which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> applies to his Doctrine, and by which the ſound Depoſing is to be diſtinguiſht from the unſound Depoſing. If you find any ſuch ſoveraign vertue in them, I ſhall be glad to learn it. But for our part, we think Depoſing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſe, a poyſon for which there is no Antidote. Diſguiſe it how you will, while it remains Depoſing, 'tis alike intolerable, &amp; alike inconſiſtent w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th the ſafety of Princes, and duty of Subjects. Call the Power indirect, call it in Temporals, not temporal, as long as 'tis Power, and can do the feat, no honeſt ear can hear it. Tell us of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and ſpace of repentance; tell us of Synods and Conſiſtories; of diſpoſing the prey according to Juſtice; of not feigning neceſſities; tell us what you will, while you tell us Depoſing is good Doctrine, we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:132"/> cannot believe you good Subjects. Bring a thouſand Schoolmen, and ten thouſand ſubtilties, againſt them all we will ſtand by our honeſt Parliament Doctrine, <hi>That the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is and alwayes has been free, and ſubject immediately to God, and none other,</hi> and who refuſes his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in that Doctrine, I know not, with what face he can pretend to a Fellowſhip in any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, I do not ſee that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with all his art does ſo much as guild the bitter Pill, or make it a jot leſs nauſeous. For what is the very worſt the Canoniſts ſay? Take their opinion in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and he ſays all they ſay, and in terms as poſitive, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive. Take <hi>Carerius,</hi> or whoever is the higheſt flyer among thoſe I ſent you at firſt, and the worſt is but this: <hi>That the Pope has juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all things both ſpiritual and temporal throughout the world; that he may abſolve Subjects from the Oath of Allegeance; Depoſe Kings; and transfer their Dominions from one line to another.</hi> And which of this worſt does <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> with his proper Diſtinctions, and cautious Buts, deny? 'Tis true, they call his Power <hi>Direct,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine Indirect,</hi> but what matter is it how they are called, if one can do as much as the other? And I would fain know, what they can do with their <hi>Direct,</hi> which be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with his <hi>Indirect.</hi> 'Tis true, they make but one abſolute Monarch of the world, and all the reſt but arbitrary Lieutenants; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cals them true Kings, but makes them as much ſubject as if they were but Lieutenants. Were Kings perſwaded once it were their duty to reſign at the Popes command, they would themſelves make no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to call and think him their ſupreme Lord. 'Tis only in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſcurvy conſequence which would follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and abſolute Lord, he might diſpoſe of his own as he thought fit, that they refuſe to give him that Title. Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſticks to the conſequence, which is all the miſchief, and makes the Pope do all that a ſupreme Monarch could do, and thinks all is well if he do not call him ſo, when as if he could do what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have him, he truly were ſupream Monarch, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might make no bones to call him by his proper name.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>would anger any King at heart, to be put out of his Kingdom, and not ſo much as know why, nay, while on the contrary he is fully perſwaded he cannot be diſpoſſeſt, even by thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs him. If a Canoniſt come and tell him, Sir, you muſt deſcend, the Pope your ſupream Lord has ſo commanded: If he believe the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, he underſtands how a ſuperior Power is to be obey'd, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as a Lieutenant, when his Commiſſion is recalled. But if <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> come and tell him, you are now a private man, the Pope has ſo declared: Without doubt, he will reply, what if he have? Have not you your ſelf told me that I am a true King, no Vaſſal of the Popes, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:132"/> ſupream in Temporals? Have not you told me, the Popes Power is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual; and do you tell me now, I muſt give up my temporal Crown, to the command of a ſpiritual Authority? All this is true, quoth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but yet you muſt obey. What! muſt I obey one who cannot command in ſuch things? Yes; he can. 'Tis ſomething hard for you to underſtand who are no Scholar; you can underſtand what 'tis to obey, and that is enough for you; the reſt belongs to us of the Trade. In my conſcience, this would ſooner put a man out of his wits, then out of his Kingdom, and who kept his wits, I believe, would go near to keep his Kingdom too.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the ſum total of the Canoniſts account is but this: That the Pope by reaſon of his abſolute ſupream Authority in all things, is not to be queſtioned, but obey'd in whatever he commands. And if <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> go leſs in ſubſtance, whatever he do in words, I am miſtaken. Nay, how much ſhort is he, even in words, when he tels <hi>Barclay,</hi> C. 17. <hi>That if the ſpiritual Prince happen to abuſe his Power, by excommunicating a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince unjuſtly, or abſolving his Subjects from their obedience without juſt cauſe, and ſo diſturb the temporal Commonwealth: This were ſin in the ſpiritual Prince, but yet that temporal Prince could not aſſume to himſelf the judgement of ſpiritual things, or judge the ſpiritual Prince, and much leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him from his ſpiritual Seat.</hi> This is worded in oppoſition to <hi>Barclay,</hi> who by the ſame Argument which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings for the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes, proves that they may as well depoſe Popes. But if this do not ſignifie, that right or wrong the Pope is always to be obey'd, I underſtand it not. For Depoſition, according to him, is a ſpiritual thing, an act of ſpiritual Power; to judge of this, a Prince muſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to himſelf, no not in caſe of Injuſtice. And if he muſt not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what remains but to obey it, and this in all Caſes, juſt or unjuſt? Let the boldeſt Canoniſt that is out-go this if he can.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, I ſee no other difference betwixt the two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that one is abominable falſe, and the other abominable falſe, and abominable full of non-ſenſe beſides. They with one bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth ſubject all Princes to the Pope, and for the reſt diſcourſe at leaſt conſequently. Were their Principle true, all would follow which they ſay. He makes Princes as much ſubject as they, and when he has done, cals them true ſoveraign Princes, and diſcourſes, ſo that no part hangs together. Every one fals together by the ears with his fellow, and makes ſuch mad work, that a body can underſtand nothing of it, but that 'tis falſe. Conſider a little what he teaches in his <hi>Rom. Pont.</hi> againſt theſe Canoniſts: <hi>That Chriſt or the Chriſtian Law, deprives none of the Right and Dominion he had before; that otherwiſe Chriſtianity would be injurious, and a wrong inſtead of a benefit, and therefore Chriſtian Rings and Emperors acknowledge no Superior in Temporals, but are true and ſupream
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:133"/> Princes in their own Kingdoms.</hi> Again, <hi>That Chriſt our Lord has diſtinguiſht the Acts, Offices, and Dignities of Popes and Emperors, that one ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to meddle with the Rights of the other,</hi> and a great deal more to this purpoſe. But that ſtrange things happen in the world now and then, one would not ſuſpect that theſe things and Depoſition ſhould both be taught by one man, and that man a friend of the Popes. Sure if I were Pope, I ſhould not think my ſelf much oblig'd by him, who gives me a Power to do injuries.</p>
                     <p>But with what Diſtinction-ſodder ſhall we ever cement theſe things? Does a King loſe nothing, when he loſes his Kingdom? Is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taken away, when all is gone? Is he depriv'd of no Right, who is depriv'd of the Right to reign? Is it no injury to be turn'd out of a Throne, to be forc't to change Purple for Rags, and languiſh out a deſpiſed life in helpleſs Beggary? Do Chriſtian Princes acknowledge no Superior in Temporals; if they acknowledge one, at whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they muſt quit their Temporals? By the way, we are at our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in Temporals again, with the meaning of which, for my late bad ſucceſs, I dare not meddle. It ſignifies you know, ee'n what you pleaſe. But let it ſignifie what it will, I am ſure no Diſtinction can hinder, but who has Power to command in Temporals, is Superior in Temporals. And he would make us believe at the ſame time, both that Chriſtian Princes know none ſuch, and yet do know a certain Perſon who can command away their Temporals from them. To make both theſe true at once, is, me thinks, a pretty confident undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Then again, what means this, that the two Powers are diſtinct, and one not to meddle with the Rights of the other? I am ſure, he does not mean, that the ſame Perſon cannot have and exerciſe both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> could not be a temporal Prince. Now I underſtand how in that caſe the Powers are diſtinct in themſelves, notwithſtanding they are united in one Perſon, becauſe that one Perſon commands temporal things in vertue of one power, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in vertue of another, which certainly he may do who has both. But when there is but one Power extended to both kind of actions, The powers certainly are then confounded, if they can be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all. For what can confounding, or mixing in this caſe ſignifie, but making one of two, which one ſhall have the vertue of both? So liquors, ſo every thing that I know in the world, are blended or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together. Wherefore 'tis <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> not the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> who truly confounds theſe Powers. They make them two, but ſay the Pope has both. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaies, he has but one, and that the Spiritual only; but would have this one Spiritual Power command both in Spirituals and Temporals. Which is of two, to make one third Power, neither wholy Spiritual, be cauſe it extends to Temporals, nor wholy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:133"/> becauſe it acts in Spirituals, but equivalent to both. And if this be not to confound the two Powers, and make one of theſe two which he ſaies Chriſt would have divided, I would be glad to learn what is, and what other way they can be confounded. And yet the jeſt is even while he does this, he preſſes the confuſion of the Powers as a great inconvenience upon the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> who are not altogether ſo faulty as himſelf, and can extricate their Doctrine a great deal better. In two words, either he confounds the Powers, and then he diſobeys Chriſt, who, he ſaies, would have them kept aſunder; or he does not, and then he diſobeys him in permitting one to meddle with the rights of the other. For certainly 'tis the right of the Temporal power to command the Subjects to that power, and require their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and ſervice: And to take away theſe Subjects and this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, is to meddle and that very far too, vvith what belongs to the right of another.</p>
                     <p>The Truth is, theſe Tricks turn a queſtion of as great importance as any in the world, into pure words and illuſion. The vvorld is in ſuſpence about the deciſion of this great Queſtion, concerning the independent Soveraignty of the two Powers, and how that command in the Goſpel, <hi>Reddite quae ſunt Caeſaris Caeſari, &amp; quae ſunt Dei Deo,</hi> ſhould be obey'd. All the learning of ten Ages teach, the powers were diſtinguiſht by Chriſt, one given to the Biſhop, the other to the Prince. The <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> and they but ſome, and all late men, teach they were given both to the Pope. This third indirect Party coming to ſettle a point of this importance, profeſs at firſt, that the Powers tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are, as Chriſt commanded they ſhould be, diſtinct, and the Pope for his ſhare has the Spiritual only. Would not any man think now the buſineſs decided, and that we had no more to do but obey our Prince in Temporals, and Biſhop, or, if you will Pope (for I will not meddle with that queſtion) in Spirituals, and there's an end?</p>
                     <p>Why this 'tis to be illiterate, ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and not underſtand diſtinction. The Popes power is only Spiritual, but yet this Spiritual power indirectly, and for the good of Souls, virtually, and by means of ſome other proprieties of ſpeech, extends likewiſe to Temporals, and may diſpoſe of Kingdoms as it ſees fit. Why then call it Temporal in the name of God, if it can diſpoſe of Temporals, and ſay the Pope is Univerſal Monarch if he be ſo, and ſtand to it. <hi>Yes we do ſtand to it,</hi> replies <hi>Bellarmin, but we love to ſpeak properly, and do not call the Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Monarch, though he can diſpoſe of all the Kingdoms of the World, becauſe he does it not in vertue of a Temporal power, but by a ſpiritual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after an indirect manner.</hi> Hang the manner how he does it, if he can do it. What has the World to do with theſe mannerly tricks? A King is well holp up, who after he is diſpoſſeſt, comes to underſtand
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106994:134"/> that this came about after another faſhion, and in another manner then he was aware of.</p>
                     <p>Well! but are you for the <hi>Canonists,</hi> or againſt them? why truly <hi>I am for them, and I am not for them.</hi> And our Queſtion, What muſt be ſaid to that? Muſt we obey our King or the Pope? This is what the world looks after. Why, <hi>according to one half of the reſolution,</hi> which ſays Princes are ſupream in Temporals, and have in them no Superiour, <hi>we muſt obey our King: according to the other half,</hi> which ſaies a power vvhich is only Spiritual can diſpoſe of Temporals too, <hi>we muſt obey the Pope.</hi> But how muſt I do with this <hi>Licet</hi> and <hi>non Licet?</hi> muſt I cut my ſelf in two, and liſt a Leg and an Arm under one, a Thumb and a Shoulder under the other, and if I happen to meet in the battle fight my King-ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Pope-ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe this is ſomething difficult, and they are men of reaſon, I imagine they would condeſcend a little in this point, and let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main entire. As long as the anſwer is divided 'tis well enough. But then I muſt chuſe the right half. That's it I would be at. Pray tell me then, muſt whole I take the Spiritual, or the Temporal half. Why, the truth is <hi>you muſt take the Spiritual half. Paraſits and Flatterers may tell you otherwiſe. But this is the truth of the story.</hi> Why then to what purpoſe all this illuſion of my Princes Soveraignty, and Independency, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all he is neither Soveraign nor Independent? To what purpoſe this buſtle againſt the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> only to ſay the ſame thing at laſt, but with more ado. Could you not have plainly told me at firſt what I muſt truſt to, and ſpared the trapan of ſo many uſeleſs diſguiſes? The reſult of all your Spirituals, and Indirects, and good of Souls, and whatever elſe, is in ſhort, I muſt obey the Pope againſt my Prince; only I muſt in ſpight of all ſence believe my Prince is a true and Soveraign King, and has no Superiour in Temporals, and the Pope no power but Spiritual, and ſo beſides a Traytor and a Rebel, become ſenſleſs, and a block into the bargain.</p>
                     <p>Here's your fine opinion, of which you make ſuch a Myſtery, and are ſo ſhy to diſcover your thoughts. Come; come; leave dodging, and deal above-board. Anſwer me theſe things, and ſhew me that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> ſpeaks ſence, and ſence not injurious to Government, and the ſafety of Princes; or diſclaim him plainly as you have the <hi>Canoniſts.</hi> 'Tis at your choice to do what you will; but do one, and that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; or take notice I tell you I will believe for the future your Church is a wicked Church, abſolutely inconſiſtent with Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and has not one ſound member in her, no not one. Put me not off with formalities, and think to ſcape with telling me, this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine belongs not to your Church as a Church, and that only the Material men hold it. 'Tis the material men I only care for at preſent.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:134"/> We converſe not with your <hi>formal Church,</hi> vve hear and ſee, and deal with <hi>Material men.</hi> Theſe are they can do us good or harm, and 'tis but reaſon we ſhould know vvhat to expect from them. <hi>Formalities</hi> are ayry things, no rope can catch them: but <hi>Material men</hi> you know maye be ſuſpended, and vvhen they are found guilty, and have no hopes of reprieve but in the innocence of their <hi>formalities,</hi> I doubt it goes hard vvith them.</p>
                     <p>In two vvords, <hi>clear your ſelves from an imputation, which you have brought upon your ſelves,</hi> or <hi>confeſs you cannot be cleer'd;</hi> and remember that <hi>ſilence is a confeſſion,</hi> and ſo I ſhall take it, as all Juſtice in the world does, and believe it vvas not the wickedneſs of the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> opinion which made you diſclaim it, but becauſe that wickedneſs came clad in ſence, and people could underſtand it. But the ſame wickedneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd in non-ſence is a Darling. So that your <hi>Pique</hi> was not to the wicked, but the ſence: make it but non-ſenſical enough, and let it be never ſo wicked you are for it. I bar <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> too, and unintelligible Subtleties. Let your Schollers keep their <hi>riddle me riddle me</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I ſhall underſtand the <hi>Talmud</hi> as ſoon, as what you call <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> meaning, I ſuppoſe, the Art of keeping things from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; The Art of talking ſo that no body ſhall know whether you ſay <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> But I underſtand what 'tis to <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Obey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to bring the whole to a ſhort plain Iſſue, I ask, <hi>If it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Pope ſhould command you to diſobey your King, and the King command you to diſobey the Pope, by whom will you ſtand?</hi> And I expect an Anſwer as plain as my Queſtion. I declare too, becauſe I will not turn our diſpute into a controverſie of Religion, nor meddle with the Popes <hi>Spiritual power,</hi> that I mean only of <hi>Temporal commands,</hi> of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands wherein you have no reaſon, nor doubt, but you ought obey the King, but only becauſe the Pope commands the contrary. Give me a direct Anſwer to this, for I tell you I bar <hi>Indirects,</hi> and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done. If you will obey your King, you are an honeſt man, and have diſclaim'd <hi>Bellarmin</hi> as well as the <hi>Canoniſts:</hi> If the Pope, you muſt make out, if you can, <hi>how he is a good Subject who refuſes to obey his Prince.</hi> The buſineſs being now in a very narrow compaſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by every body, there I leave it, with this Advertiſement, <hi>that upon your Anſwer depend the thoughts I ſhall have of your Church, or,</hi> if you will, <hi>men of your Church.</hi> According as you Anſwer <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> I ſhall believe you conſiſtent, or not conſiſtent with Government. There I began, and there I end. I hope you will give me no occaſion to chang my thoughts of you; for truly 'twould grieve me if I could not, with as much ſatisfaction to my Judgment as Inclination, own the title of,</p>

                     <p>ME thinks you deal roughly for a <hi>Friend.</hi> If I were as brisk as you, here would be brave doings. What a buſtle do you keep with me, with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the <hi>Church?</hi> and all, becauſe I deſir'd to keep my thoughts to my ſelf. Truly I thought <hi>ſilence</hi> no ſuch hainous crime. I have known many repent of ſpeaking, but few of holding their tongues. But for my ſelf you may deal as you pleaſe; twenty to one but I may at ſome time or other find occaſion to cry quittance with you, and then I expect you ſhould allow me the liberty you take. But <hi>Bellarmine! what harm his he done you, to incur your indignation ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Is he the only man who maintains the</hi> Indirect Power? <hi>And if he were, can you not diſprove him fairly, and let your bitterneſs alone?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> too! Pray, <hi>what is ſhe concern'd whether I do as you would have me or no? Can no Member of her Communion diſpleaſe you, but ſhe preſently muſt be brought in? She is this,</hi> and <hi>ſhe is that, if I do not what I have no mind, and, for all your earneſtneſs, I fear no reaſon to do.</hi> But you have got an eye of me, and you follow it. You know I value the <hi>Church</hi> above my ſelf, and that I will never agree ſhe ſhould be ill thought of, if I can help it. Indeed I was in hope to have cut the Thread, and anſwered ſo, as might pleaſe you, and diſpleaſe no body elſe: But ſince 'twill not be, and that there is no way to clear her from thoſe blemiſhes, which your capricious Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie has caſt upon her, but by forcing my own inclinations, I think my ſelf oblig'd rather to expoſe my ſelf to other mens cenſures, then leave her expos'd to yours. If any man diſlike my reſolution, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him for one moment to make my caſe his own, and conſider what he would do, ſo loudly and ſo ſmartly challenged, and what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires he ſhould do, when on the one ſide the Churches reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is at ſtake, on the other the quiet, it may be credit of particulars. If he doubt which ſide to take, I muſt needs think, <hi>he has leſs reſpect for his mother then becomes a good child.</hi> For my part, I am perſwaded otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Well! But you will not be ſatisfi'd unleſs I ſpeak plainly. Would I knew whether you will be ſatisfi'd if I do. For I tell you truly, I begin to be as jealous of your earneſtneſs, as you of my reſervedneſs. If rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would have ſatisfi'd you, I think you might have been ſatisfi'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time. However I will venture to make one experiment more, and try what I can do with you by and by. If you be in earneſt, and that plain dealing will do it, I ſhall prevail at laſt. For I will tell you, and that very plainly, more then you ask. You ſhall know not only what I think, but why I have been thus backward to tell you what I think. I will frankly diſcover all my policy, which makes you ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, peradventure to be as much laught at for my ſimplicity: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, you ſhall have no cauſe of jealouſie of what I harbour in my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:135"/> breaſt, when you know all I harbour there. But do not think I mean to be ſo merry as you are. I am in no ſuch pleaſant humour, and think the matter a little too ſerious. If you had ſpared ſome of your mirth, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'twould have been ne'r a whit the worſe. The meat might have been altogether as good, if the ſauce had been leſs tart. But to our buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>You are ſtill harping upon the <hi>Church.</hi> A worm of Jealouſie is crept in, and will not out. You are ſtill ſuſpicious, <hi>ſhe forbids people from deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely in theſe matters.</hi> I told you there was no ſuch thing, and I tell you ſo again, at leaſt that I know, and I tell you beſides, <hi>That had there been ſuch a thing, and I known it, I would have dealt as ſincerely with you, as</hi> Fiſher <hi>with King</hi> James, <hi>told you ſo at firſt, and never medled ſo much as I have done.</hi> But if you will know the true cauſe of my reſervedneſs, know that you your ſelf have a great ſhare in it. You are all on fire, becauſe I ſay not preſently what pleaſes you. I ſuppoſe you do not imagine but there are men of tempers as hot as you, whom that will diſpleaſe, which pleaſes you. Beſides the Queſtion is of a particular nature. It has been can vaſt heretofore with much animoſity. The fire is not yet dead. It flames not indeed at preſent, becauſe the fuel of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is taken away, but the heat lyes rak't up in mens hearts, and would eaſily break out again. I would not for all the world be he, who ſhould blow this heat into a new flame. But for that, I conceive, my breath too faint, and inconſiderable. However, as I love not to meddle with hot men at all, ſo I would gladly be guilty of ſo much policy, as not to provoke hot men upon a hot ſubject. Whether I ſay, I or No, one hot ſide will be apt to take offence. Wherefore I thought it the beſt way to hold my tongue. Now your fantaſtical curioſity is not ſatisfi'd with this, but is as hot upon my ſilence, as others may be upon my ſpeaking: And would perſwade me, you play the <hi>Friend</hi> all the while. I hope you will ſend me the next time to ſtir a neſt of Waſps, and make me believe it a point of Friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>However, I aſſure you, the <hi>Church</hi> has nothing to do with my <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> neither do I, or ever did apprehend any thing from her. The Church has other imployment, then to look ſo low as I am, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God forbid, that Innocence ſhould not be ſafety enough for any of her Communion. All that I apprehend is the heat of private men, of thoſe with whom I am like to meet and converſe, and from whom I may chance hear twenty croſs Queſtions. 'Twould vex me to have a man come to me, and ſay: <hi>You Sir! Pray how long have you taught Divinity, or in what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity taken degrees, who preſume to handle ſo freely, men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for their learning with all Divines, and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities? The world is at a fine paſs, when a little pert confidence ſhall ſet up every pidler in learning, against thoſe who have ſpent their lives in nothing elſe.</hi> Again, You paſs for a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and acknowledge, at leaſt in words, <hi>That the Pope is ſupream
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:136"/> Paſtor.</hi> 'Tis done like a dutiful Child to go about to leſſen your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The next time you write I hope you will leave him no power at all. I fore ſee the next piece will be of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and then there is hopes you may in time proceed to the <hi>three Impoſtors.</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Heretical ſpirit</hi> this, and beware of it. I may be in a froward humor when I hear this, and it may be return a froward anſwer; and then we fall out, and he tells every body he meets, <hi>I am in a dangerous condition, tottering upon the very brink of perdition, and 'tis great luck if I ſcape the precipice.</hi> Every body who hears this ſaid, and that confidently, and gravely, will not hear what I can ſay for my ſelf; or if they did, they are but few with whom the ſolemn outſide will not carry it againſt a better reaſon then I ſhall be able to produce. And then I paſs for <hi>dangerous,</hi> or <hi>buſie,</hi> or <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> as they pleaſe to frame my character. My Friends begin to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skew at me, and all the ſweetneſs of converſation, and innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of hearty Friendſhip is loſt. This would be wonderful uneaſie to me, and if it ſhould happen, as 'tis like enough, I ſhould, whatever you do, think it <hi>a great inconvenience.</hi> In fine <hi>every man has his humor,</hi> and mine is <hi>not to make an enemy of ſo much as a Cobler, if I could keep him my Friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon why I ſo readily diclaim'd the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> becauſe <hi>I meet with none who are like to give me any trouble about them.</hi> And this is the reaſon why I was more reſerv'd in the other opinion, becauſe <hi>I may meet with this trouble.</hi> I hope you will not think this a reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my communion, as if they were more troubleſom to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours then other folks. <hi>Men are men of all communions, and hot men are hot men, and ſuch are impatient that any perſwaſion they have wedded ſhould be contradicted.</hi> This is all the diſquiet I foreſaw and apprehended, and the great Policy with which you keep ſo much ado. And if it be Policy <hi>to think my thought quietly to my ſelf,</hi> as I elſewhere told you, <hi>and not fall out with every man who thinks otherwiſe, nor give any man occaſion to fall out with me; to think I have no commiſſion to Reform every thing I diſlike, but that there may and will be errours in the world, let me do what I can:</hi> I avow to you, I would have been a <hi>Politician,</hi> if you would have let me, and am very ſorry you did not.</p>
                     <p>But now we are upon <hi>Politics,</hi> let me tell you one thing by the way. <hi>You are a meer Mortal at</hi> Politics <hi>as well as your Neighbours.</hi> What work do you make with the buſineſs of 88, and how ſlily do you make it paſs <hi>for an effect only of Hereſie?</hi> If you do in earneſt believe ſo, I can tell who's the <hi>Sir Pol.</hi> But ſure you underſtand things better, then not to know, <hi>Pretence</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Cauſe</hi> another. 'Tis true <hi>Hereſie</hi> was pretended, and it may be was a partial cauſe too, of as much as the <hi>Pope</hi> did. <hi>But do you think the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was at all that charge purely upon the account of Zeal?</hi> Sure you do not think him ſo great a Saint. Or if you do, all the world knows 'twas <hi>Intereſt of State,</hi> not <hi>Religion,</hi> which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:136"/> rais'd that Army, and ſet out that <hi>Armada.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> ſtood in the way of his great thoughts, and ſo croſt his deſigns upon other mens domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that ſhe made him unable to recover his own. This obſtacle to his ambition he had a mind to remove; and <hi>Religion</hi> was no bad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence among his own Subjects, vvho vvere and ſtill are exceeding Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but he ſo little valued it himſelf, that he would not ſo much as own it. And this a better <hi>Politician</hi> then you or I, <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> has obſerved: <hi>Some,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>would have had the war proclaimed by a Herald, but others thought the right of claim from the Popes ſentence would make out but a lame Title.</hi> And theſe it ſeems were the wiſer, and carried it. See now what conceit the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had of your <hi>Politic Cauſe,</hi> and no better had we in <hi>England.</hi> For though <hi>Mendoza</hi> had vainly boaſted of I know not what affection of ſome principal men here towards the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in all likelyhood to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate his own diligence, yet <hi>whatever his thoughts were,</hi> ſaies <hi>Grotius</hi> again, <hi>it appeared true afterwards that however</hi> Engliſh <hi>Catholics might differ in Religion, there was, none of them ſo imprudent as to truſt their Lives and Fortunes to the undiſtinguiſhing ſword of a Forreign Conquerour.</hi> And yet they were at that time as much affected to the <hi>Pope</hi> as any people in the world, and thought as highly of his power. And for all that they did not think <hi>he had power to diſpoſſeſs their Soveraign, and diſtinguiſht right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt Pretence of Religion, and Reaſon of Intereſt.</hi> I can aſſure you we are of the ſame mind ſtill, and know <hi>an Invader,</hi> let him be never ſo much a <hi>Catholic, is an Invader, and,</hi> let him pretend vvhat he vvill, <hi>means to enſlave thoſe he Invades, and alwaies will.</hi> He that comes vvith a <hi>Croſs in his mouth,</hi> and a <hi>Sword in his hand,</hi> vve know vvhat he vvould be at, and ſhall never be ſo ſenceleſs to be diverted by vvhat he ſaies, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering vvhat he vvould do. I tell you once for all, <hi>we would fight as freely againſt the Pope as the</hi> Turk, <hi>if he come like a</hi> Turk <hi>in Arms;</hi> and you may eaſily believe me: for all Nations do it vvithout difficulty when there is occaſion; <hi>French, Spaniards, Italians</hi> themſelves have all had their turns. Marry if he come like a Pope, <hi>to direct our feet in the ways of that peace, which Chriſt bequeath'd as a legacy to his Church,</hi> I for my part vvill fall down at his feet, and kiſs them too, laugh you as much as you vvill. In the mean time I vvould adviſe you, as you do me, <hi>to let</hi> Politics <hi>alone,</hi> and not go about to perſwade the vvorld, <hi>Hereſie was the cauſe of all the danger of</hi> 88, vvhen if there had been no ſuch thing, there had not been one Ship, or one Souldier the leſs. Had Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> been <hi>Inquiſition-proof</hi> as much as King <hi>Philip,</hi> he vvould have done juſt as he did: For <hi>'twas the enemy of</hi> Spain, <hi>and friend to</hi> Holland, not <hi>the enemy to the Pope,</hi> vvith vvhom he had the quarrel. Had the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf been in her place, the <hi>Pope</hi> had been invaded as ſhe vvas. And this I ſay not altogether by gueſs, <hi>for both he and his Father actually did
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106994:137"/> invade the Pope, and his Father take him priſoner too.</hi> But ſo much for your <hi>Politics,</hi> and my reſervedneſs, of which I have now given you the very reaſon, and told you the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> I wiſh you had ſpared ſome of your <hi>ſmartneſs. He was a great man,</hi> and if you would undertake to anſwer all that he has writ, peradventure you would go neer to find him ſo. Nay do but write on any, chuſe what you think the eaſieſt, Subject, as much as he has done of intricate matters, and if you do not ſomewhere or other give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of as much ſport as you have made with him, I ſhall much marvel. A great piece of Maſtery it is, out of ſo many Volumes, where 'tis impoſſible the Author ſhould alwaies be equally attentive, to pick out a few lines, and turn them to <hi>Burleſque.</hi> If I had a mind to take his part againſt you, perhaps I could make it appear, <hi>He is not altogether ſuch an Aſs as you would make him, even in this queſtion.</hi> For example, <hi>You quarrel with him becauſe,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>he forgets to explain what he means by</hi> Indirect <hi>where he firſt uſes the word.</hi> As if thoſe againſt whom he then writ, did not underſtand it well enough, and need no explication. His notion pleaſes not you, and you ſay <hi>it is not the Notion of the world.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be not. <hi>He writ to that part of the World which underſtood it in his Notion. If they underſtand one another, what is't to you and me what words they uſe?</hi> Again; you ſay, <hi>He makes no uſe of that word in the whole courſe of his Arguments. What is it to purpoſe whether he did or no? It may be he had no occaſion.</hi> But if you conſider his Arguments, you will find they proceed all upon what he underſtands by <hi>Indirect Power,</hi> and that they are all along oppoſite to the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> who maintain in the Pope <hi>a power properly Temporal,</hi> whereas he places in him <hi>only a Spiritual Power;</hi> and then endeavours by thoſe Arguments to prove, <hi>that ſupream Spiritual Power, may in vertue of its being ſo, extend alſo in ſome caſes to Temporals:</hi> which is in his language to be <hi>Indirect,</hi> and was ſo underſtood by thoſe againſt whom he intended his Arguments. So that he is ſo far from forgetting, as you imagine, his <hi>Indirect,</hi> that he makes uſe of it and nothing elſe. More I could ſay in his behalf if I had a mind. But I mean not to engage for him. He has friends a great deal more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then I, who can ſpeak for him, when they think convenient. As you have ordered the matter I have enough to do to quit my ſelf However I mean now to endeavour it, and quit my ſelf ſo, if I can, that I may hear no more of you. For I am very weary of being baited thus long at one ſtake, and will come no more there, if I can help it.</p>
                     <p>I tell you then I will ſtand by your <hi>Parliament-Doctrine,</hi> as much as you or any of his Majeſties Subjects, and take it unkindly at your hands you ſhould ſurmiſe I would do otherwiſe. That Parliament was a <hi>Catholick-Parliament,</hi> if you remember, and might have put you in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106994:137"/> mind, that <hi>Catholicks may be both good Catholicks and good Engliſhmen.</hi> 'Tis true, there may be <hi>Traytors</hi> of them, and thoſe Traytors may diſguiſe their Treaſon <hi>with the pretence of Religion,</hi> as who would not get as hand ſome a vizard as he could for ſo ugly a face? But 'tis plain, that <hi>their Religion has no inconſiſtency with their duty to their King and Countrey,</hi> when we ſee their <hi>Religion</hi> was no hindrance to them, <hi>for providing for the liberties of their Countrey, againſt the encroachments of pretended Religior.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>I conceive it more ſhameful, and more wicked for us, who perſevere in the ſame Faith, to degenerate from the ſame Loyalty, then for men of other perſwaſions.</hi> But to go on: I diſavow and deteſt the wicked and pernicious Doctrine, which teaches <hi>the depoſition of Kings,</hi> whom I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to hold <hi>independently of God,</hi> and will be ready on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to lay down my life in confirmation of this Truth; and when you pleaſe, will give under my hand, that 'tis <hi>new, falſe, erroneous, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>ſeveral ways miſchievous beſides, and will never maintain any opinion to the contrary.</hi> I know not how you will reliſh this way of ſpeaking, but I can aſſure you, 'tis a way in which wiſer men then I, have walk't before me. But to give a direct Anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to which you have reduc't the whole, and which by the way, I am very glad you have confin'd to <hi>Temporals,</hi> (for I do not mean to be perſwaded out of my Religion by your earneſtneſs) I anſwer thus: <hi>That I will at all times, and in all occaſions, ſtand by my King, againſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Power, and under whatſoever pretences.</hi> And becauſe you are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly jealous of the Pope, I declare, <hi>I will ſtand by my Soveraign, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it my duty ſo to do, againſt the Pope, as firmly as againſt any other, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded, he has no Power</hi> Direct <hi>or</hi> Indirect, Virtual <hi>or</hi> Formal, <hi>or by whatever names it has or may be call'd, to depoſe or diſpoſſeſs him of all or any part of his Dominions, or authoriſe his Subjects not to perform faithful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him. And I abſolutely diſclaim all Doctrine to the contrary, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever maintained, and under whatſoever diſguiſes. And if you diſtruſt my word, I will pawn you my hopes of ſalvation, and ſwear all this in as ample manner as you can deviſe, provided, you keep within the bounds you have ſet, and intrench not upon Spirituals.</hi> For you deſire I ſhould deal plainly with you, and I muſt tell you plainly, <hi>I mean, by the Grace of God, to be as good a Catholick, as a Subject, and hope, I do you no harm by meaning to ſave my ſoul.</hi> Now if you be not ſatisfi'd, it is no fault of mine, and I muſt believe, ſay what I will or can, <hi>you are reſolv'd not to be ſatisfi'd.</hi> Which if it be ſo, I am ſorry with all my heart you have put me to ſo much fruitleſs trouble, for truly I could have ſpent my time ſomething better then in <hi>waſhing the Brick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I am in the humour of telling you all I know, let me tell you farther, <hi>I am not alone of this perſwaſion.</hi> Whenever you make it as ſeaſonable for other people to ſpeak their thoughts freely, as you have made it neceſſary for me, I do not think you will find many <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:138"/> who will leave you much ground of jealouſie. At leaſt I am ſure of this, <hi>That there is no Catholick, who may not remain as good a Catholick as the Pope himſelf,</hi> in the blunt phraſe, <hi>and ſay as much as I do.</hi> Thoſe who will not, if there be any ſuch, are not hindred by any, either <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Command</hi> of the Church, but by <hi>Principles,</hi> which whether by the credit of the maintainers, or whatever flaſh their eyes are dazled, they miſtake for more effectual then they are. Notwithſtanding if you meet with any ſuch, I freely conſent, you <hi>make as much ſport with them as you will, and bar you no part of the pleaſure, I doubt, you take even in your jealouſie, and which, I fear, you would be loth to part with.</hi> But, to my knowledge, there are who would gladly give you ſatisfaction in this Point, if you would receive it.</p>
                     <p>Pray permit me a little liberty too, and let me ask you a Queſtion or two in my turn. You know, as well as I, <hi>there are of us, who hold in this matter what diſpleaſes you,</hi> and <hi>there are who do not.</hi> You who talk ſo much of <hi>honeſty and uprightneſs,</hi> pray <hi>where is the honeſty and the uprightneſs to treat us both alike, and give the honeſteſt man that is, the portion of a Knave?</hi> Do you think it a juſt thing, <hi>that one man ſhould bear the burden of another mans faults,</hi> or <hi>that thoſe Nations do well, who when any one offends, puniſh all his relations?</hi> You keep us all under the ſame diſcouragements, and yet know we do not all deſerve it. You allow us no means to clear our innocence, ſuch as you know are clear, and ſhould we find a means our ſelves, our caſe is ſtill the ſame as if we were guilty. Honeſt or not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, all is one with you. If you ſay, <hi>You know not which are which,</hi> why do you not know it? You may when you pleaſe. But ſince you do know <hi>that ſome,</hi> whoever they be, <hi>are innocent, thoſe innocent men ſhould rather bear out the guilty, then the guilty condemn the innocent.</hi> I think men of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcience would chooſe to <hi>let twenty guilty men ſcape, before they would let one innocent man ſuffer.</hi> At leaſt in other caſes, <hi>the Law does not condemn any man, becauſe he is not known to be innocent, but frees him without more ado, unleſs upon ſufficient proof he be in particular found guilty.</hi> With us 'tis otherwiſe: <hi>becauſe ſome are perhaps but thought guilty,</hi> (for till it come to trial, that's all can be ſaid) <hi>it takes hold of innocent and all.</hi> Nay, <hi>we are not admitted ſo much as to a trial,</hi> nor <hi>allow'd to plead Not-guilty, with any plea which ſhall be any way beneficial, and free him, who is found ſo, from any thing to which he is liable who is cast.</hi> In fine, You pretend, and endleſly pretend <hi>diſſatisfaction,</hi> yet <hi>no ſatisfaction will be receiv'd from thoſe who could, and gladly would give it.</hi> Whatever men be, <hi>to look upon them ſtill as guilty, and keep them ſo, in ſpite of all they can do, to make out their innocence, and not ſuffer them to paſs for other:</hi> In two vvords, <hi>To make men liable to puniſhment whether they will or no, and then puniſh them, is in my opinion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard dealing.</hi> I am perſwaded, you are ſenſible enough that <hi>This</hi> might be preſt. But I forbear, and only vviſh you to clear things as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:138"/> vvell as I have done. You are ſo nice at receiving ſatisfaction, that I ſhould be very ſorry, you had this to object againſt me. I fear, I ſhould have much ado to make your ſqueamiſhneſs believe otherwiſe, <hi>but we were in love with ſeverity, and reſolved not to part with any pretence of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for me I think I have done my part, and ſo clear'd all vvho are perſwaded as I am, <hi>that if you continue your jealouſie againſt us, 'tis very plain, you are jealous for ſome other reaſon then demerit in us.</hi> And becauſe you ſhall perceive I am in earneſt, and ſpeak, not only in force of your importunity, but according to the perſwaſion of my beſt little Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I vvill go a little farther, and tell you vvhy I am thus perſwaded. For I vvould not have you think, your <hi>Arguments</hi> alone have done the feat, and that being formerly either unſetled, or vvrong fixt, they have converted me: And yet I muſt frankly acknowledge, <hi>I cannot anſwer them in the main, though if I had a mind to keep up the wrangling Ball, I could perhaps here and there pick out enough to give you ſufficient trouble.</hi> But I have always been of this Judgement, and you might perceive ſo much by the Relation I made of the <hi>Arguments;</hi> in vvhich I did not play the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian</hi> ſo impartially, as not to diſcover ſufficiently vvith <hi>which part I ſided.</hi> So much ſharpneſs as I mingled vvith the Narrative, could not proceed from one <hi>who thought well of the Arguments.</hi> By the vvay, <hi>I now wiſh there had been leſs.</hi> For ſince you muſt knovv all, <hi>that heat was indeed but counterfeit, a diſguiſe I put on, in hopes to excuſe my ſelf from plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering my own face.</hi> Othervviſe more modeſty to learneder men then my ſelf, had been more ſuitable <hi>both to manners and my humour,</hi> and 'tvvas vvith regret I ſhevv'd no more reſpect to them. But I thought there vvas no great harm to ſpeak a little freely of Books, vvhoſe Authors are by death <hi>exempt from all ſenſe of wrong,</hi> and if they vvere alive, perhaps <hi>would not take much offence at any thing I ſhould ſay.</hi> But I perceive I muſt give over <hi>Policy.</hi> 'Tis a Trade in vvhich I am not skil'd, and thrives accordingly.</p>
                     <p>To acquaint you plainly then with what I harbour in my breſt, I muſt profeſs that as far, as I can judge, <hi>This Depoſing doctrine, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever garments of diſtinctions clad, as much as 'tis pinn'd upon our Religion, is more inconſiſtent with our principles, then thoſe of any other perſwaſion: ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, that were it once eſtabliſht for</hi> Catholic doctrine, <hi>inſtead of being an advantage to the Church, as they who favour it ſuppoſe, it would be the ruin of it.</hi> One of our Principles is <hi>reſpect to the Ancient Fathers,</hi> which he that would take away, would do the <hi>Church</hi> very bad ſervice. Every body knows what <hi>reverence</hi> we profeſs to thoſe <hi>great lights,</hi> and what <hi>veneration</hi> we pay to their <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>vertues.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? <hi>that they were ignorant of a doctrine, which is pretended was taught by Chriſt, they who underſtood what Chriſt taught ſo well, and defended it ſo zealouſly</hi> Can it be imagined <hi>our new Schoolmen know more then theſe great men, who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:139"/> of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>againſt oppoſers as ſubtle as any that have ſince appear'd, diſcovered a learning, which for ought I perceive After-ages have more reaſon to admire, than think they can equal. But if they knew as much as they do now, it can be leſs ſuſpected from their Vertue; that they would conceal their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſuppreſs a truth of this importance.</hi> I cannot readily fancy any thing more incredible, not to ſay a harſher word, than <hi>that a point of no leſs concern than the performance of our duty to God, and his Vicegerents, Kings, ſhould lye dormant in breaſts inſpired with ſo much zeal, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo much knowledge, for Ten whole ages, and at laſt break out, and ſurprize the world with a new-light.</hi> Nor do I ſee <hi>how it can be thought poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without imputing either</hi> Ignorance <hi>or</hi> Diſhoneſty <hi>to thoſe, who of all men in the world are fartheſt from the ſuſpicion of either. I ſhould be ſorry to be, or ſee the</hi> Catholic, <hi>who ſhould in good earneſt think either imputable.</hi> And yet if they knew this doctrine and did not conceal it, we muſt of neceſſity have heard of it long before we did. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th is the firſt unqueſtionable Author of it: For though a little more <hi>Antiquity</hi> be ſometimes pretended, yet thoſe pretences are in truth but weak, and little better then meer conjecture. All that I can imagin poſſible to be ſaid in the caſe, is, <hi>that they had no occaſion to declare their knowledge, but being buſied with other controverſies ſaid not all they knew in this.</hi> But I fear this cannot be maintained. For they do often treat of <hi>both Powers,</hi> explain their natures, and ſettle their bounds. They tell us the one conſiſts in <hi>conſtraint,</hi> the other in <hi>freedom;</hi> That one has to do with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Divine things;</hi> the other with <hi>Human:</hi> That one inflicts <hi>Corporal,</hi> the other <hi>Spiritual puniſhment,</hi> and the like. Was there no occaſion all this while to have given one touch of this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> and <hi>Indirect Power?</hi> one little hint at the diſtinction, if they had known it? Let them think ſo that pleaſe. For my part I conclude <hi>they knew it not;</hi> thoſe who think otherwiſe may conclude if they pleaſe, <hi>that they would not teach what they knew,</hi> but conceal'd a point of <hi>Chriſtian duty,</hi> and which they knew to be ſo: and ſo by ſeeking to juſtifie they knew more than we can poſſibly tell they did, ſince they expreſs it not themſelves, call in queſtion their <hi>vertue</hi> which we all know.</p>
                     <p>But yet bare <hi>ſilence</hi> is not the caſe. They teach the direct contrary. They teach <hi>there are none who can puniſh Kings but only God;</hi> that <hi>we for our parts are to obey even unjuſt and wicked Princes,</hi> and this <hi>becauſe God has ſo commanded, whoſe ſecret, but yet just, Providence, places over us, as well</hi> Nero's <hi>as</hi> Conſtantins: That <hi>the Church has no ſword but the</hi> Spiritual, <hi>which to extend to</hi> Temporals <hi>is Arrogance.</hi> He that can reconcile theſe, and twenty other of their expreſs doctrines with the <hi>depoſing Power,</hi> may never ſtick at any thing, or fear that <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> will ever ſtand in his way. In fine, <hi>They allow us no other diſobedience then in caſe of commands contrary to what God has commanded before, and no other reſiſtance, even in this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:139"/> caſe, but of prayers, and tears.</hi> Put them to have known the efficacy of our diſtinction, and that it was lawful, while directly we are oblig'd, <hi>to pray like Chriſtians,</hi> indirectly <hi>to fight like</hi> Turks, and they have dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheated the vvorld, and trapan'd the Church into many a ſevere Perſecution, from which let them ſay what they will, ſhe had force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have freed her ſelf, if ſhe had thought it lawful to uſe it. Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves had the confidence to tell their <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors</hi> to their faces, <hi>they wanted not ſtrength to revenge themſelves, if they had thought the defence of their lives a juſt excuſe for reſiſting their Prince,</hi> or <hi>the Sword a lawful instrument to introduce the Goſpel.</hi> But they knew <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> was not to be eſtabliſht by <hi>fighting,</hi> but <hi>preaching,</hi> and that <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is not the way to ſet up <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> If their Prince bad them fight againſt his Enemies, they did ſo: but if he himſelf became their Enemy, they choſe, as was their duty, <hi>to die rather then fight againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The truth is, people may ſay and think as their fancy guides them, but <hi>Force is not the way to preſerve or introduce true Religion. Falſhood</hi> may need it, but it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>kens <hi>Truth.</hi> Conſider which way the wiſdom of God went to work; <hi>As rain into a fleece of wool, as drops of dew diſtilling on the earth.</hi> He who had an unreſiſtable power, would not uſe ſo much on this occaſion as to break even <hi>a bruiſed reed.</hi> 'Tis evident by the choice of unerring wiſdom that this is the proper way of <hi>Truth,</hi> and that 'tis a deceitful wiſdom, and takes wrong meaſures, which goes otherwiſe. And indeed what can be more wild, then to think <hi>to force men into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and make Saints of them whether they will or no?</hi> We ſee what <hi>Christ,</hi> what his followers did, we know how we were taught by the great and beſt ſucceeding Maſters of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> I ſhall never be perſwaded, <hi>that thoſe who taught in this manner, were acquainted with theſe indirect ſubtleties;</hi> at leaſt we ſhould have been acquainted with them much ſooner if they had. In fine, I cannot but think, there is very little of a <hi>Catholick ſpirit,</hi> in introducing a Doctrine, not only <hi>unknown to the ancient Fathers,</hi> but <hi>ſo oppoſite to their Maxims, that it cannot well be imagined how they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it more plainly then they do,</hi> unleſs we fancy them Prophets too, and <hi>that they foreſaw all the ſubtleties which ſhould be brought in the world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they left it.</hi> Otherwiſe we cannot expect they ſhould talk of Direct and Indirect who never thought of either. But they plainly ſay, <hi>There is no Power in the Church but</hi> ſpiritual, <hi>and that this</hi> ſpiritual Power <hi>does not extend to</hi> Temporals: Again, <hi>That Princes have none to call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but only God,</hi> and <hi>that juſt or unjuſt they muſt be obey'd, ſaving only in unjuſt commands.</hi> And if any diſguiſe of words can hinder this from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plain determination of the Thing, I muſt needs profeſs, I know not how it can be determined by them.</p>
                     <p>But forgetfulneſs of the Fathers, I fear, is not the worſt of the Caſe. It is pretended in the behalf of the <hi>depoſing Doctrine,</hi> that it relyes on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:140"/> 
                        <hi>divine Right,</hi> and the hot abetters of it will hardly ſuffer thoſe to paſs for good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who reject it. The truth is, <hi>they cannot well go leſs.</hi> For while it is acknowledged, as on all hands it is, <hi>That ſubjection to Princes is commanded by Gods Law,</hi> that which takes away this ſubjection muſt be <hi>Gods Law</hi> too, or nothing. And indeed conſidering the import of the Queſtion, and the immediate influence it has upon a main Point of duty, it cannot well be doubted, <hi>but the Truth,</hi> on which ſide ſoever it be, <hi>dees belong to Gods Law</hi> Certainly the Wiſdom of God, <hi>who took fleſh purpoſely to inſtruct the world in all neceſſary duty,</hi> did not leave out ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part. Now that his <hi>Law</hi> teaches, we are to obey <hi>temporal Princes,</hi> is both plain in it ſelf, and, as I come from ſaying, plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by every body. But 'tis evident, <hi>we cannot at the ſame time obey two Powers commanding contrary things.</hi> Wherefore I cannot ſee, <hi>but to require obedience in Temporals to the ſpiritual Power, by the ſame Law which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands obedience to the Temporal,</hi> is <hi>to make that Law contradictory, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be obey'd.</hi> Which as 'tis a Blaſphemy intolerable in any <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſo I fear, 'tis unavoidable in thoſe who put a <hi>temporal vertue</hi> in the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power.</hi> For that <hi>vertue</hi> plainly obliges to <hi>obedience in Temporals,</hi> to which obedience we are obliged by another vertue, that of the <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power.</hi> And this is to require we ſhould do what <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf has aſſured us is impoſſible to be done, <hi>ſerve two Maſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The way by which they ſeek to avoid this, is by ſaying, <hi>Kingly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as inferior, muſt yield to Papal obedience as ſuperior.</hi> Which I think is, <hi>by ſtriving to weather</hi> Scylla, <hi>to ſplit upon</hi> Charibdis. We have aſſurance from thoſe, whom we have more reaſon to credit, <hi>that Kings are inferior only to God, and have none above them but him alone.</hi> I ſuppoſe this is to be underſtood of the ſame kind of Superiority. For otherwiſe 'tis ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enough for the ſame man to be both <hi>Superior</hi> and <hi>Inferior</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſeveral reſpects: as a <hi>Father</hi> to a <hi>Son,</hi> who is a Magiſtrate. But 'tis plain there is no reconciling this Doctrine, with that of a <hi>Papal Superiority in Temporals.</hi> We may as ſoon obey both when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand contraries, as believe one has no Superior beſides <hi>God,</hi> to whom the <hi>Pope</hi> is Superior.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is another thing which ſticks more with me. This <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Superiority in Temporals</hi> is no where to be found, but in their own fancies. There is no ſuch thing in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition, Councils</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> To obtrude upon us an invention of their own heads, and this for a part of <hi>Gods Law,</hi> is <hi>to add to the Law of God.</hi> Let them either ſhew that place of Gods Law, which teaches, <hi>Kingly Power is inferior,</hi> and <hi>Papal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,</hi> and this in <hi>Temporals,</hi> or ſhew how they do not give us for <hi>Gods Law,</hi> that which is not, and entitle themſelves to the <hi>maledictions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalyps. Feed my ſheep,</hi> and, <hi>whatſoever you ſhall bind</hi> is not, <hi>Kings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in Temporals,</hi> and their interpretation, which hooks in <hi>Temporals,</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:140"/> is not <hi>Scripture.</hi> Beſides the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has forbid the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted againſt the unanimous conſent of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> And if any one <hi>Father</hi> can be brought, who Interprets thoſe places as they do, or who does not Interpret them quite contrary, if he meddle with them at all, truly there is more to be ſaid for them than I am aware of.</p>
                     <p>But let us conſider a little farther. In a Queſtion which belongs to <hi>Chriſtian duty,</hi> and <hi>the law of God,</hi> how does, or how ſhould a <hi>Catholic</hi> proceed? I conceive who goes to work like a Catholic, <hi>ſhould frame his</hi> belief <hi>according to his Rule of Belief.</hi> I think that is the uſe of a <hi>Rule.</hi> To my judgment they go not this way, who are for <hi>Depoſing;</hi> as indeed they cannot. For if <hi>Tradition</hi> be, as I conceive it is, the <hi>Catholic Rule,</hi> there is no applying this Rule to <hi>Depoſition.</hi> Look into all <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Arguments. Thoſe in his <hi>Rom. Pont.</hi> are all from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> deducing ſuch inferences from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or acknowledg'd points of <hi>Catholic Doctrine,</hi> as make to his purpoſe. Theſe deductions, till they be acknowledged rightly made, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto is deny'd, and that upon very good grounds, have no force at all to induce <hi>belief,</hi> and though they were acknowledg'd, would make at moſt but a <hi>Theological</hi> concluſion. Thoſe againſt <hi>Barclay</hi> are all from <hi>Authority,</hi> and this Authority is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a ſingle Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> 8, or a great many ſingle men, or thoſe men met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Councils. For as for <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he pretends, and which indeed would do the buſineſs, if it declared it ſelf, he makes nothing of it. Now there is no number, or quality of men, let them be <hi>Catholics</hi> never ſo much, which obliges to a belief of what they ſay, otherwiſe then when they witneſs, <hi>the point in queſtion was received by them from their Ancestours as taught originally by Chriſt, which teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs hands it over, for ſuch a point, to thoſe who come after.</hi> In all other caſes they ſpeak their own private judgments, and this whether <hi>ſingle,</hi> or <hi>aſſembled,</hi> and for that reaſon are not parts of <hi>Tradition,</hi> or the <hi>Catholic Rule,</hi> and make no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Belief.</hi> And theſe being all the waies they have to the wood, I do not diſcern the <hi>Catholic way</hi> among them.</p>
                     <p>But what is the conſequence? There are but two things acknowledg'd by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> to which we are oblig'd to ſubmit our Judgments, <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> if theſe be truly two and not one thing with two names. For as for Councils, <hi>They belong to</hi> Tradition, <hi>and are when duly qualifi'd the moſt conſiderable parts of it.</hi> In Scripture we find <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and this for <hi>Conſcience, poſſeſſing our Souls in patience, expecting our reward in the next world,</hi> and the like, no word of <hi>Depoſition.</hi> Look into <hi>Tradition,</hi> and we find Ten whole Ages perſwaded and practiſing according to the ſame Maxims, <hi>perſevering in faithful obedience to juſt commands, and patient refuſal of unjust ones, and apprehending they were oblig'd by the law of God ſo to do.</hi> We find all the <hi>Fathers</hi> of all thoſe Ages confirming them in this apprehenſion, and inculcating the duty of <hi>Obedience</hi> even to <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</hi> We find <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves not only <hi>teaching</hi> but <hi>practiſing</hi> the ſame Doctrine, obeying commands ſometimes thought <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi> and ſubmitting with <hi>patience</hi> to the pleaſures of their then acknowledg'd Lords, the <hi>Emperours.</hi> This is, if any thing can be, <hi>ſemper &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bique, &amp; ab omnibus.</hi> And this is the known Rule of the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> The oppoſite Opinion began at ſuch a time in ſuch a place, and by ſuch a Man; and when it began was cry'd out on <hi>as a novelty con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU had ſav'd your ſelf and me ſome trouble, if your laſt had been your firſt. I almoſt deſpair'd of doing any good upon you, and perceive that <hi>exſculpere verum</hi> out of one of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, is one of the hardeſt tasks in the world. But ſince 'tis come at laſt, I regret not my own pains, and for yours, it was in your power to have ſpar'd them. But yet I have not done with you. The Pope is a crafty Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and has more ſtrings to his Bow then one. Shut the door never ſo faſt, it is hard to keep him out. If St. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys will not open the lock, He has St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſword to cut it off. Not that I apprehend any great danger from downright fighting. 'Tis a Trick he ſhews as ſeldom as he can: And he has reaſon; for Kings overmatch him at that weapon. But Juſtice has a ſword too, and that ſo ſharp that I ſhould be very ſorry to ſee it in his hands. Now that there may be juſtice without deriving it from <hi>Paſce Oves,</hi> or <hi>Dabo Claves;</hi> and that it may belong to him as well as others, and by the ſame means; And that he actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has heretofore, and may, when he pleaſe, again ſet on foot pretenſions, upon this Title, to part, perhaps all his Majeſties Dominions, is ſomething too evident to be deny'd, and of too great importance to be neglected. It is a thing which has long diſquieted me with uneaſy thoughts; but I muſt freely avow to you I was never ſo ſenſible of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as ſince I read the <hi>Conſiderations of preſent Concernment.</hi> You are ſo much concerned in that Book, that I muſt needs ſuppoſe you have ſeen it, and obſerv'd how much may be replyed to what you have ſaid to me. But I am for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo intent upon what's before, that I cannot reflect on what's paſt. Hereafter poſſibly, when I am in a calmer diſpoſition, and my ſetled ſpirits at more liberty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what he ſays to you, with what you have ſaid to me,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:143"/> I may call you to a new account, and ſee whether you can maintain what you have written. But at preſent, taking all you have given me in payment for currant mony, let us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee how far 'twill go.</p>
                     <p>That in relation to you, and ſuch as are principled like you, we are ſafe from all pretenſions of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> which the Pope can have upon us, I fairly allow you. Are we therefore ſafe? Plainly No, if he have right over us any other way. Nay whether he have right or no, ſo he but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and you will own his pretence, we are as bad as ever. There is a thing call'd <hi>Human Right</hi> in the world, by which men enjoy their lands, and goods, and whatever they call with truth their own. It has not altogether ſo glorious a ſound as the other, but is not much leſs efficacious; for the World could not ſubſiſt without it. Now although what the Pope claims by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> be enough, as he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders matters, to ſatisfy a not very unreaſonable man, yet his claim by that, is no bar from claiming by any other Title too, by which Right may be had. He may Purchaſe, as well as another man, or receive a Gift, or Legacy, &amp;c. and what he gets by theſe, or any other ways, by which the property of things is transfer'd, is as truly his, as they would be of any other man by the ſame Titles. And who can blame him, for joyning as much Silver as he can to his Gold?</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, we have made a fine hand on't with all our wiſe ſpeculations, and are much beholding to you, for furniſhing us with Armour of proof againſt the ſharp point of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> while the <hi>Human</hi> may chance knock out our brains with her clouterly club. If there be no fence for this flayl, we are as much at his mercy as ever. Now <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> has taken care that no man ſhould be ignorant, that He may claim both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and this indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and in vertue of ſuch Titles as are allow'd to create Right in other men. I muſt confeſs, though He ſpeak plain enough, yet I was not ſo much ſtartled by him, whom I took for a partial man, and who I ſee intitles him, to the better part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> as well as <hi>England.</hi> This ſeem'd a fancy too wild, to deſerve much credit; and I thought while our caſe was not ſingular, but common to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:143"/> ſo many and ſo powerful States, and which engaged the ſtrength of Chriſtendom on our ſide, we were ſafe enough. I conſider'd we were pretty well out of the way, and that he could not come at us, till he had poſſeſt himſelf of ſome little countries which lye between us, and which I believ'd would find him work enough, to let us ſleep in quiet, and need no better ſecurity then that of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes,</hi> to be devour'd laſt. But I perceive, by the <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> the caſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>different from what I fancy'd. The Pope I find has ſomthing to ſay to us, which he cannot ſay to every body, and which, to tell you truth, I am ill at eaſe to ſee can be ſaid.</p>
                     <p>I know you will ſpare me the labour of tranſcribing out of a book which I believe you have, at leaſt may have, on every ſtall. Pray what ſay you to it? The Author is no <hi>Baronius,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to be ſuſpected of partiality to the Pope, and though he were, Reaſon is Reaſon whoever ſays it. Blind juſtice ſees neither Friend nor Foe, and values not whether it be on the left or right hand the ſcale goes down. Truly I do not ſee we are a jot the better for all your hardly drawn out condeſcendencies. We are at the <hi>en Tierce</hi> and the <hi>en Quart</hi> again. While the Pope plays fair Play, we fear him not, but what ward for his foyning tricks? Certainly he is no ſuch fantaſtical man to inſiſt more on the way then the end. He will be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt to drive the nail that will go, and, ſo he can get a Kingdom, be ſatisfied to take it as it comes, and like it nere the worſe for bringing a bare <hi>Human</hi> title along with it. But whatever he would think, we cannot agree he may with juſtice do any thing to our prejudice. Nay a <hi>Human</hi> title would be ſo much worſe than a <hi>Divine,</hi> by how much we muſt all acknowledge, that <hi>Human Right</hi> is a true <hi>Right,</hi> ſince we have no other to whatever we poſſeſs and hold dear in the world, whereas we are leſs acquainted with the other.</p>
                     <p>Tis not but that I believe we may with our Author, rely ſecurely on Preſcription. But with ſuch a Gameſter, and for ſuch a ſtage, 'tis good to play ſure. Beſides there is as much danger from <hi>what is apprehended</hi> as from <hi>what is.</hi> Bare Right alone will do no great feats; it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and abetted to become efficacious: And if that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:144"/> which truly is not Right, be taken for Right, and will be ſtood to, and maintained, it will do as much as if it were Right. Now Preſcription which our Author ſays is, our only, but withal a very ſufficient, plea, he ſays alſo the Pope will not allow. And we know how much influence he has upon thoſe of his Communion, and hovv prone you are to be of his opinion. If you be of his mind in this particular, and admit no Preſcription againſt him, then whether he have Right or no, you at leaſt are perſwaded he has, and will undoubtedly act according to your perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when time ſerves.</p>
                     <p>I have a little too much reaſon to be concerned for this point.<note place="margin">Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getica de Jure Regni Hiberniae Authore C.

Though <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were unconcern'd, <hi>Ireland</hi> is too conſiderable a branch to be turn away from the ſtock. 'Tis Treaſon in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance to imagine the diſpoſſeſſing our Soveraign of any part of his Dominions: and here are plenty of men with hard names produc't to prove, it is conſonant to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Catholick Authors, to diſmember a great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at once, and this without any relation to <hi>Divine Right,</hi> though it be ſlightly toucht by the by. And for ought I know, you may pick as many holes in our Preſcription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, as this Author does in our preſcription to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Twenty to one but <hi>Scotland</hi> will be hook't in too ſome way or other; or though it be not, it will go near to fall in of it ſelf, either as part of <hi>England,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Britain,</hi> or by ſome other fetch. It would undoubtedly run the fate of its Neighbour Kingdoms, and it is not a pin matter for a Title to that, which muſt come in at laſt, and when it comes will bring Title enough with it. Nature and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make perhaps as good Titles as Law, and I know not whether the Law have any better then poſſeſſion. If the Pope get once poſſeſſion, as when he has got <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſee not what can keep him from it, 'twil be to no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106994:144"/> more purpoſe to be ſollicitous for a Title, then for a man to look after a horſe, who is at his journies end. For Titles ſerve but to obtain, or hold what they pretend to, which he that has already, and ſo, that it cannot be taken away, no longer needs them. But if the worſt come to the worſt, why may not the Pope diſpenſe with a Title, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, altogether as hard, and not altogether ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious? Plenitude of power, ſet once on the tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, I believe will ſtretch as far as that, and what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he do, Who can do all which is neceſſary for the good of the Church, and who is alone to determine what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary?

                     <p>I did not expect to be importun'd again at a time, when you may very well think I am but ill diſpos'd to write. When I ſee the well meaning of ſuch, as I am, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted for a piece <hi>of dangerous craft, dreams of bold under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers and men of ſpeculation; when any kindneſs or Indulgence to a</hi> Roman Votary, <hi>of whatever Principle or ſubdiviſion he pretend to be, is concluded to be ſtilling a Tempeſt by whiſpering to it, or reclaiming a Viper by receiving him into the boſom;</hi> while the unſheath'd Sword of the Law hangs over my head, and may fall, for ought I know, even while I am at it: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will eaſily believe I have no more ſtomach to writing, then the flattering fool had to his meat. Truly did not the queſtion concern the duty of a good Subject, from which I believe no croſs accident a ſufficient diſpenſation, ſilence, or excuſe ſhould have been all my anſwer. For as the world goes I foreſee no fruit of my writing, but to make the Author paſs for a ſcribling Emperick, who makes the diſeaſe worſe then it would be, by ſtirring humours unſeaſonably. I know not why it is not as wiſe to go on endleſly with Mercury and Coals, as continue to ſow the ſeeds, as ſimple I think, of good intelligence and mutual love, and reap nothing but heightned jealouſies and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities. To ſet me a writing, what purchaſes me the reputation of a Fool and a Knave to boot, and ſtill to urge me to write, is to ſtretch the power you have over me with the fartheſt. Notwithſtanding, the Subject being of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, I ſhall overcome the repugnance I have to meddle more, with the conſideration of my duty, and let you and the world ſee, that <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> and <hi>Severity,</hi> and whatever you pleaſe to lay on deſpicable Papiſts, ſhall not hinder them from being affected as they ought, to the Honour and ſecurity of their Prince and Country. Uſe me as you pleaſe, I ſhall continue to deſire, and, as much as you will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:147"/> let me, contribute to the ſervice of both. If the ſucceſs be not anſwerable to all the hopes, with which my ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city has ſometimes flatter'd me, One better grounded, I am ſure will not deceive me. I hope receive from the Grace of God a conſtancy in my duty, whatever the face of things be, and from his goodneſs a recompence above what man can give, and <hi>repoſita eſt haec ſpes mea in ſinu meo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To come to your Letter, I muſt acknowledge I have ſeen the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> to which you refer me. Whatever I think of the Book, I think very well of the Author. And that for more then one Reaſon. There is in him great Reading, and great Judgment, and great Candor, and care to ſpeak ſtrong ſence in unoffenſive language, ſo that he diſobliges not, even when he confutes. In ſhort <hi>He is</hi> one, ſuch, as when I think my ſelf able to hold up a ſide, I would wiſh for an Adverſary. I wiſh him one as learned and as candid as himſelf, and then we may hope to ſee the Truth fairly try'd out between them; and let her carry it on Gods name on which ſide ſoever ſhe be. For what concerns my ſelf, I ſhall defend what I have ſaid againſt his exceptions, as well as I can, when you require it; which I hope you will not do, till you find me ſomething better diſpos'd.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding I wiſh he had ſpared his two firſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, which I believe leſs digeſted then any thing he ſays beſides. They are framed againſt the ſuppoſition of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ſettlement of Popery. May they be hang'd, without more ado, for grand Traytors as they are, who think ſuch a thought, if there be any, which becauſe I firmly believe there are not, I complain of a ſuppoſition too injurious. There needs no caſting about for Topicks to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of ſuch a ſuppoſition, if it could be made. Force cannot be without miſchiefs too obvious to need proof, but likewiſe too exorbitant to aſperſe people with them on ſuppoſitions, and thoſe ſo unreaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. The Papiſt is not the hundredth, I am confident not the thouſandth man in this nation. When he does any thing by force, the old miracles muſt return, <hi>one chaſe a thouſand, and two ten thouſand.</hi> I ſay nothing to the firſt Topick, becauſe it has nothing to do with my preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and for another reaſon, which I think not ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:147"/> convenient to expreſs. Beſides I doubt not but the Authors zeal for Religion, will move him to conſider it over again, and give a ſolution to his own argument.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is what you make the principal part of your letter, to which being to ſpeak more at large hereafter, I only obſerve for the preſent, that it ſeems ill ſuited to his purpoſe. It is <hi>fear of the Popes pretences on</hi> England <hi>upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Right, in caſe the return of Popery ſhould give him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſet them on foot.</hi> Now I conceive the return of Popery neither makes, nor mars, in the caſe. For if the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be good, Proteſtants cannot avoid them; if bad, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will not admit them. Right is Right to Proteſtants, as well as Papiſts, and no Right has the ſame no force on us as you. Popery would not hinder us from pleading Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, nor Preſcription from having its efficacy. It ſounds juſt as if he ſhould ſay: Let us keep the Pope out right or wrong, for if he ſhould come in, it may chance be ſound he has a Right which we are reſolved not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, whether he have it or no. Such a diſcourſe I take to be diſhonourable to his own Religion, as if they car'd not to do unjuſtly, and hinder other folks of their due; dangerous to the Commonwealth; and ſuppoſing a falſity too palpable to admit of ſuppoſition, namely, that the Pope may have a Right to <hi>England.</hi> But this by the by, and for an exception to the fitneſs, not ſubſtance of his diſcourſe. For though I think it not proper to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and every jot as ſtrong againſt themſelves as us, yet the difficulty, as he has manag'd it, truly with more ſtrength then I have ſeen it urg'd elſewhere, both deſerves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an anſwer. I hope we ſhall no longer paſs for men blindly addicted to the Pope and his Intereſt, when the world ſees a Proteſtant take the Popes part, and a Papiſt the Kings againſt him. As tenacious as we are of what we believe his due, I truſt it will be acknowledged we believe nothing due, which may keep us from being true to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Country, when all the diſcouragements we receive from our Country, hinder us not from ſtanding faithfully by it, in oppoſition to his undue pretences, whenſoever, and by whomſoever, and howſoever urg'd. And theſe are ſo urg'd, that no Arguments, with which I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:148"/> have had occaſion to meddle, of his profeſt Champions, have given me ſo much to do.</p>
                     <p>But reſpiting this matter a little while, I will take the liberty to alter your order, and begin at the latter end of your letter, becauſe what you ſay there, is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from what goes before, and things of a kind do beſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. You object that <hi>I am a ſingle, and, which is more, a conceal'd man, and all I ſay or do inconſiderable.</hi> And 'tis true that I am inconſiderable enough all wayes, whether in learning or credit. Notwithſtanding I thought my ſelf able to anſwer your Objections. If you thought it not conſiderable, whether they were anſwered or no, you did ill to put me to ſo much fruitleſs pains. I thought you had ſufficiently conſidered why you engaged me to write, and lookt no farther then to anſwer as truly and plainly as I could. To tell me at laſt that all my pains are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is a very unexpected objection, and to which all I can anſwer is to complain of you, for putting an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable employment upon me, who could have ſpent that inconſiderably taken up time with ſome more ſatisfaction, and it may be advantage to my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>being ſingle,</hi> if it were ſo, I ſhould hope there is no ſuch urgent neceſſity, that a man ſhould be puniſht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has no company. To ſay, as you do, that the Eye of the Law cannot look on particulars, is ſomething ſurprizing, when we ſee them found out and brought to puniſhment every day; and why particulars may not, with as much eaſe, be indemnifi'd, as puniſht, I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. 'Tis a plain caſe that the care of the Law does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to particulars, and in other caſes, provides for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of every ſingle man, whoſe guilt excludes him not from their protection. Me thinks 'tis very hard that <hi>Peter</hi> muſt ſuffer becauſe he is not <hi>Paul</hi> too, or becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> will not think as <hi>Peter</hi> does, therefore <hi>Peter</hi> too muſt go to pot, and two be puniſht becauſe one offends. But to give you ſatisfaction in this point, according to your own fancy, conſider that Merit, and Demerit are general things, and proper objects of the care of Laws. Encouragement of the one, and Diſcouragement of the other, are the hinges on which Government turns. Law-makers, without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:148"/> heads, and counting how many come under one, or the other branch, frame their Laws in general, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Hopes and Fears to make them chuſe right, leave Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to the choice of their own wayes. Let the ſame Providence be extended to this caſe, which if it were not to others, Commonwealths would hardly ſubſiſt, and I have no more to deſire of you. I hope 'twere no diſgrace to the Law, if I were the only man who reap't benefit by it.</p>
                     <p>But indeed I am not ſingle. I have heretofore told you there are more of my mind, and I tell you again you ſhall find it ſo, if people once may freely ſay what they think. But while you involve us all, guilty or not guilty, in the ſame maſs of perdition; while we are ſure to be no jot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſpeaking, and not ſure but we may be much worſe, by adding diſſatisfactions among our ſelves to the ſeverities we fear from you; me thinks you ſhould not complain of our ſilence. This is to tye up a mans tongue, and then blame him for ſaying nothing. Pray let us ſee ſome good likely to come of ſpeaking, either to you, or our ſelves, or ſome body, before you oblige us to expoſe our ſelves to more harm then we are ſubject to already.</p>
                     <p>No Friend! 'Tis not Fear of being diſown'd by my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which conceals me, but <hi>Fear</hi> I ſhall be no better; <hi>Fear</hi> I may be worſe lookt on by you; and if you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay it, <hi>Grief,</hi> for having that cauſe of Fear. Not but that I know well enough that every one of my Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is not of my perſwaſion, in this point of the Popes power. But you know I have often declared, I deſire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour only for thoſe who are. How many there be, truly I know not, nor will uſe any endeavours to know. For I fear you would not take it well, if any of us ſhould go about to make an eſtimate of the ſtrength of a party. There may be more, there may be fewer: But the fewer there be, the leſs reaſon, I ſhould think, to exclude them from your protection, ſince evidently there can be no danger from a few. How I fear, if we ſhould prove more then you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, you would then object number to us, with a little mroe ſpeciouſneſs, and a great deal more concern! Since every body deſires to have as few Enemies as they can,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:149"/> while you will not let us be friends, I cannot believe you much in earneſt, when you object fewneſs to us. You ſay this becauſe it came in your way, but otherwiſe would be better pleas'd, if I miſtake not, if we were fewer then we are. Indeed you urge not this fewneſs as dangerous, but as inconſiderable. But why ſhould Innocence be thought ſo inconſiderable a thing? Innocence is Innocence in one man as well as a thouſand, and ſhould not be caſt careleſly away. If the Laws would take into their protection ſuch only as ſhould give you the ſatisfaction, which your ſelves ſhould judge reaſonable, perhaps their number may prove great enough to deſerve their care, and then you would have what you deſir'd; however it is not unworthy the care of Laws to provide that no man ſhould ſuffer without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit.</p>
                     <p>Now I am upon this Subject, pardon a little freedom, and a little Tautology. You complain I am ſingle, and conceal'd, and will not take notice that 'tis your dealing which makes me ſo. What reaſon has any body to joyn with me, what reaſon have I to diſcover my ſelf, when doing ſo will make us worſe then we are already, which I refer me to your ſelf if it be not bad enough? You will not be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, but with what you know will cauſe diſſatisfaction among our ſelves. A man that had any jealouſy in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would ſtartle at this: but yet while your pretences for thus much are at leaſt ſpecious, thoſe whoſe conſcience will allow them, are willing to do as you would have them, ſatisfy you your own way, and upon your own Terms. When this is done you are as little ſatisfy'd as before. And out come harſh ſuſpitions, of I know not what craft and danger cover'd under theſe ſpecious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendencies: out come harſher things then bare ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Sword of the Law hanging naked over our heads, and threatning us with all the ſharpneſs of its unavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble edge. You will not let us paſs for good Subjects, till we have done what no Nation in Chriſtendom, beſides your ſelves, thinks neceſſary for the trial of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Sure the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not the only good Subjects, nor the only wiſe men of the world. However when a man has paſt the teſt of your uttermoſt ſcrupuloſity, and may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:149"/> be call'd a good Subject, even in your nice language, then has this good Subject to expect for his comfort, which will be taken, his twenty pound a month, or his two Thirds. Shall I venture to ſay, what has, by ſome leſs credulous, been long thought? As Princes reſolv'd to make War, would yet be thought inclin'd to Peace, and ſeek to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World they draw not their Swords but forc't by Juſtice and neceſſity, ſo deal you with us: no anſwer that is or can be made to their Reaſons, ſhall keep the <hi>Ratio ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima</hi> from thundring at laſt, nor no return we make to your Objections ſhall hinder you from what you have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd concerning us. Whether we ſtand on our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or yield to you, whether innocent or guilty, They are perſwaded we ſhall with all our ſeveral Principles and ſubdiviſions, Wheat and Tares indifferently be bound up together into one condemned bundle, and thrown into the fire at laſt. This they gather partly from your objections, which in truth are wonderful croſs, urging now Danger, and then Craft, now Number, and preſently after Fewneſs, and when one is taken taken off, you never fail of another, nor ſhew any diſpoſition that you ever will. They gather it more apparently from your Actions, more certain ſigns of the mind by far than words, and think it a fooliſh thing to gueſs at what you mean by what you ſay, when they ſee what you do. When a Prince fills the Frontiers with Magazines, and Souldiers, and Weapons, they think his intentions plain enough, and judge not of them by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts. If this be what we muſt truſt to, which truly I ſhall be the laſt man who believes, if the good Subject muſt be condemned, that the Papiſt may not eſcape, and no hopes of living with comfort in this world, but by forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hopes of the next: It is not for us to think of any thing but the next World, and thoſe comforts which will not fail us, of good Chriſtians and a good Conſcience. And I very earneſtly entreat you to leave me in quiet, as long as the Law will let me, to ſtudy, what only becomes me, Patience. For to ſtudy longer how to ſatisfy thoſe who will not be ſatisfy'd, and with a great deal of pains purchaſe the reputation of one more dangerous than thoſe who will not, perhaps cannot, anſwer you, is not more uncomfortable than irrational.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:150"/>
                     <p>Is not your next Objection a kind of ſecret Declaration (to uſe the Figure call'd a Bull) of your mind in this point? You would have it <hi>impoſſible ſo much as for a ſingle perſon to give you ſatisfaction, becauſe one may prevaricate even while he renounces prevarication.</hi> I cannot tell how far you are in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; but this to my eye looks like a reſerve in ſtore, when other pretences fail, to maintain a reſolution of admitting no ſatisfaction. Otherwiſe can you ſeriouſly believe there is no truſting, no taking one anothers word, becauſe the Doctrine of Aequivocation has been taught in the world? If this were true, Cities and Societies had been left off by this time, and we had in Deſerts been experiencing the comforts of the returned Golden Age. For there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſociety without mutual truſt. Thoſe doctrines do not hinder us from keeping up ſociety ſtill, and dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſecurity enough, and if we can give ſecurity to one another, ſuch as ſerves the turn, and enables us to converſe and treat with confidence, what ſhould hinder but we may give it to you too?</p>
                     <p>But let us look upon the Objection: Some of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion have thought Aequivocation lawful, therefore none may be truſted. Do you think this Inference concluding? Will you have every one of our Communion anſwerable for what is ſaid by any one? Pray conſider whether Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have not been maintain'd, by ſome of your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with which if others ſhould be charged, they would think themſelves not fairly dealt with; it is no more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to impute theſe doctrines to our Communion, in which if there be who hold, there are too who contradict them. The <hi>Yea</hi>'s and the <hi>No</hi>'s ſhould not be confounded, and which is more unjuſt, the <hi>No</hi>'s condemn'd for the fault of the <hi>Yea</hi>'s. For my own particular, I could produce, if that would ſatisfie you, ſufficient Compurgators for my innocence in this particular, and ſufficient witneſſes, that I never believ'd Aequivocation lawful, nor was ever taught it was, nor ever heard of it without a ſcurvy character. But then if the fancy ſhould take you to except againſt my Compurgators, you would leave me no means to make out my Innocence, and yet I am very ſure I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:150"/>
                     <p>Yet let me tell you, if you go this way to work, you may chance be caught in your own Trap. For this is no point of Religion. It belongs purely to Learning, and may be held by men of different Communions. You read our Authors as well as your own, and I ſuppoſe aſſent to as much as you think true in them. Pray who ſhall be your Compurgator, that you do not your ſelf hold this doctrine which you object to me? And why may not I as well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you of Prevarication, as you me? For 'tis nothing to purpoſe that it is not found in your Books: You may think it true by what you find in ours; and if you may, who ſhall ſecure me that you do not? And then there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but we muſt all into the wilderneſs. But if you think your ſelf ſufficiently juſtifi'd, that no word or action of yours, has given a reaſonable ground of ſuſpicion, that you believe the doctrine true, truly I can ſay as much for my ſelf, and if need be, bring good proof of what I ſay. If this will not do, I know not how either of us can clear our ſelves, nor how we can deal with one another, or any body elſe with either of us.</p>
                     <p>I conceive therefore this Topic of yours is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and as a Canon overcharged burſts it ſelf inſtead of hitting the Enemy, becomes ineffectual by having too much force. For evidently if your Inference be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that none of us can be truſted, this is alſo true, that abſolutely none can be truſted, whether of us or you; and if there can be no Truſt, there can be no Society in the world; which is a Concluſion ſo deſtructive, that the Argument muſt of neceſſity be deceitful which infers it. To dive far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the buſineſs belongs not to me. If you will not take this in payment, demand your debt where it is due. I for my part owe you no more on this account, than you me. For I never held Aequivocation lawful no more than you, and am no more to anſwer for it. I ſhall only ſay, that were we indeed ſuch Juglers as you ſeem to fear, ſo dextrous at the Legerdemain of Aequivocation, nothing you could do would exclude us from any benefit which other Engliſhmen enjoy. You know well enough that words cannot be ſo contriv'd, but ſophiſtry may work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and if we thought it allowable to take advantage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106994:151"/> by it, we ſhould long before this have taken all your Oaths, and it may be, by ſtretching our Conſcience a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſſembled in actions as well as words, and gone to Church, and taken your Sacraments, and continued Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts all the while. Alas! we need not trouble you for Phyſick, if we had ſuch a Remedy of our own in ſtore. But you know no diſcouragements, no apprehenſion, even of utter ruine, has prevailed with us to do, what yet you would perſwade us we think we lawfully may, and which if we did,<note place="margin">§. 54.</note> we were ſtark mad to refuſe. The candid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> has truly obſerv'd, ſuch a liberty would deſtroy us, and I hope you are ſufficiently ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if you cannot be undone by us but by undoing our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you touch ſlightly upon Probable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, more I ſuppoſe with the exuberancy of a flowing fancy, then check of a real concern. Theſe Doctrines have been ſo treated by thoſe of our Communion, that I believe you ſufficiently perſwaded there are not many of yours who have leſs kindneſs for them. I know not how you can uſe them worſe than to place them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aegidius Gabrielis</hi> ſpecimina Moralis Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicae. pag. <hi>293.</hi>
                        </note> as a late Author has done among the <hi>Devils Morals.</hi> However it be, they are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid open to the view of every body, and we have taken care you ſhould not be ignorant of any thing we know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. In my opinion it is needleſs for me to ſtay on a Subject ſo largely treated by better pens, guided by more acquaintance with them. All I ſhall return by way of anſwer is, that I can give you no more light than you have already, and that you may, if you truly apprehend any danger from them, provide for your own ſecurity, as you pleaſe, and treat thoſe, who ſhall refuſe to give it, as you pleaſe too. If this do not ſatisfie you, nothing that I can ſay, will.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid thus much to your collateral exceptions, I come at laſt to the principal buſineſs of your Letter, thoſe Pretences which the Pope may have by <hi>Human Right.</hi> Though you obſerve it not,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus <hi>Diſt.</hi> 96.</note> I conceive it beſt to follow the order of Time, and begin with the famous <hi>Donation of Conſtantin.</hi> Of this there is a very formal Charter extant in the Canon Law, and ſaid by ſome to be preſerv'd in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106994:151"/> which <hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and all the Weſt are convey'd to the Pope, beſides other particulars, which concern not our queſtion. There is great diſagreement among learned men who treat of this Argument. Some labour to make good the <hi>Charter,</hi> others the <hi>Donation</hi> only, and there are who reject both the one and the other. I ſpeak only of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for as for yours they all agree with the latter. Now although I conceive that to overthrow either, is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw both, (for if the <hi>Charter</hi> be forged; the <hi>Donation</hi> cannot be prov'd, of which this is the only Evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or produceable; and again if the <hi>Donation</hi> be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the <hi>Charter</hi> cannot be valid) yet to conſult my own eaſe, I chuſe only to ſpeak to the <hi>Donation,</hi> leſt the nice ſcrupuloſity of thoſe who think the <hi>Donation</hi> may be true, though the <hi>Charter</hi> be falſe, ſhould engage me in a new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For the <hi>Charter</hi> let it ſuffice that it is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by men of greateſt Learning and Judgment, and among the reſt by <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>ad an.</hi> 1191. <hi>n.</hi> 52.</note> one not likely to caſt away ſlightly any thing that makes for the advantage of the Pope.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Donation,</hi> it ſeems the product of a fancy little acquainted with Nature, and the courſe of human action, or at leaſt little minding them. <hi>Conſtantin</hi> was a Prince, who with great labour and fortune prevail'd againſt his powerful Competitors, and eſtabliſht the Empire in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his family. I cannot eaſily imagin a conceit more wild, than that he ſhould ſo little value, what he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſ't with ſo much toil and danger, as to make a preſent of the beſt part of it, to one who never ſo much as ask't him for it. Princes do not uſe to think ſo ſlightly of their Dominions. Soveraignty bears a greater rate then ſo, nor will they much ſooner conſent to forego a part, then the whole. Or if the ſuſpicion might paſs ſon not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Princes, by long and quiet enjoyment of Power, grown weary, or perhaps inſenſible of what they enjoy, as men become cloy'd with the ſame conditions as well as the ſame meats; yet 'tis hardly imaginable of ſuch a man as <hi>Conſtantin.</hi> He had fought hard, and often, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for what he had; he had ſtaked againſt it his Life and Honour, and all he had and hoped. He who ſtruggles
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:152"/> into Soveraignty through ſo many difficulties, muſt needs value it more, than to throw a great part of it away, as ſoon as he has got it. He might without any hazard or pains have quietly enjoy'd, almoſt as much, as if his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were real, he reſerv'd to himſelf. For certainly a compoſition might have taken up all differences with his Competitors, had he been careleſs of more than enjoying his own ſhare with ſafety. But he was a man of another ſpirit, and into whoſe head it never came to diſpoſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of what he had obtained with ſo much dangerous pains. But if the motion came not from himſelf, it is more wild to fancy it ſhould proceed from any body elſe. Who would dare to ſpeak to him of diſmembring the Empire? And what Chriſtian (for Infidels ſure cannot be ſuſpected) would by ſo mad a zeal have expos'd all Chriſtianity to evident ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard? Had he once perceiv'd it an intereſted Religion, and which entertained bold ambitious thoughts, even to ſhare the Empire with him, and transfer to themſelves the fruit of his labours and victories, nothing but miracle could have kept him from thinking better of his old.</p>
                     <p>Again he he had Children whom he train'd up as Princes, and entruſted with the care of ſeveral Provinces. Will any man of ſenſe beleive, that after he had with much care made them fit for government, he ſhould leave them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to govern? and having bred them Princes in his life time, oblige them to turn private men after his death? Without all doubt if Nature would have allow'd him cauſleſsly to diſinherit his Children, and give away their Birth-right to Strangers, Prudence would have inſtructed him to diſpoſe them to this change of their Fortunes by their Education, and excepting Him, whom he deſign'd for Succeſſor in the part reſerv'd to himſelf, to enure the reſt by cuſtom to brook that private condition, in which he meant to place them. He was a good natur'd man, and lov'd his Children; he was a wiſe man, and his natural judgment wonderfully ſtrengthned by experience of all ſorts of affairs, could not be to ſeek how to lay means for the ends he purpoſed. This fancy leaves him neither natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection nor wit: but ſuppoſes after he had rooted out thoſe inclinations which nature plants ſo powerfully in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:152"/> every body, and this without any demerit on his Children ſide, or any ſhew on his, who alwayes teſtify'd the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Father to them, He ordered the matter ſo croſly, as to diſpoſe things quite contrary to what he intended to bring them.</p>
                     <p>But let it paſs for once: Let it be ſuppoſ'd, againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the courſe of his life, he would do ſuch a thing: may it be ſuppoſed he could? And I ſpeak with reference to Nature, not Law. Waving the many, and thoſe not eaſily anſwerable, legal exceptions which ſome have taken to this Grant, I only enquire what was likely to follow while men were men, and acted as men uſe to do. His Children were Princes, who by their Birth expected, and by their Education were acquainted with power. Unleſs they conſented to this Donation, and voluntarily yeilded up their pretenſions, I ſee not to what purpoſe it could be. Undoubtedly they would never be contented to ſit tamely down, and ſee their Birth-right given away againſt their wills. Or if they would, ſome of their Poſterity would have had more ambitious ſpirits, and ſtruggled with all their force to recover a height, to which they were once ſo near. 'Twas a very prepoſterous Piety to entail per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual confuſion on the Empire, and expoſe it to greater and more laſting troubles, than thoſe from which the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Fortune of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> had newly reſcu'd it. He that can fancy ſo wiſe a Prince ſhould entertain a Project of ſuch a deſperate conſequence, and ſo impoſſible to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, has a fancy, in my opinion, fitter for Romances than any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>And yet peradventure there is not much leſs difficulty on the ſide of the Taker, than the Giver. 'Twas yet the Age of wooden <hi>Chalices,</hi> and golden Prieſts. Popes in thoſe days were holy men, and very free from the ſuſpition of Ambition. They were ſo far from looking after Worldly advancements, that they accepted not of Spiritual but by force. <hi>Silveſter,</hi> to whom the Donation is pretended to be made, did no way degenerate from the holineſs of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, making himſelf one in the Catalogue of Popes who were ſaints. He was not a man to increaſe the heavy burthen, of the care of Souls, with the weight of temporal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:153"/> and far from being tempted by the glittering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of worldly greatneſs, I beleive would have fled from it, as a hinderance to a duty, which he took a great deal more to heart. Leſs diſtractions, than the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good part of the World, were long after his days complained of by holy men, though perhaps not holyer than himſelf.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe a man in veneration for ſanctity even to this day, overcome by the temptations of greatneſs, ſo powerful with frail nature, what ſhould he have done with this power, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is ſaid to have given him? The World was like to be well govern'd, when from the Caves of <hi>Soracte,</hi> a man ſhould ſuddainly be tranſplanted into an Imperial Throne, and He who had ſpent all his time in the meditation of Divine things, and treating with afflicted poor people, with whom he kept company in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and perpetual fear, ſet to rule great nations, full of unquiet Martial ſpirits, and as much uſ'd to war as He to his Books, and perhaps as much in love with it? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt whoever invented this ſtory, was not uſed to check his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ery fancies with conſideration of what was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or poſſible. Turn it which way you will, 'tis pure <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> on all ſides.</p>
                     <p>But I need not amuſe my ſelf with examining what was likely or not likely, when it appears, by the uniform con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Hiſtorians, that actually there was no ſuch thing. The Empire was, as Nature and Reaſon required, governed, after the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by his Children, ſhared among them by himſelf, who is ſaid to have given ſo much away before. Thoſe very Provinces, ſaid to be conveyed to the Pope, were by his Teſtament bequeath'd to <hi>Conſtans</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the Eaſt to <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> By vertue of this Teſtament they enter'd into Poſſeſſion, and were themſelves, and their ſucceſſors after them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the only Lords of the Countries under them by all the reſt of the World, and by the contemporary Popes, as well as others, till at laſt the revolution of human things, rent the Weſt from the Eaſt by the breaking in of barbarous Nations; ſet up a new Empire in the Weſt, upon a new and independent Title; put a period to the Empire of the Eaſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:153"/> by the <hi>Turks;</hi> raiſ'd the Pope to a temporal Principality, and brought the World into the condition it is in at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The names and actions of theſe ſucceſſors of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> with the wayes by which they came to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are recorded in Hiſtory, the Pope not taken notice of all the while, nor any claim of his ſo much as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. He had no hand in the ſucceſſion of the following Emperors, no voice in the election, no approbation of the Elect, no coronation, no acknowledgment, no ſign of ſupream Dominion, but as another Subject obey'd thoſe, who by Election; or ſucceſſion, or Force, came to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. I mean till the Empire was tranſlated to the Weſt, for as he had a great hand in that tranſlation, he has ever ſince appeared more; but I ſpeak of the times before. And all this is evident beyond all diſpute.</p>
                     <p>Reconcile this, who can, with <hi>Conſtantins Donation.</hi> If he put the Pope in poſſeſſion of the Weſtern Provinces, how could he bequeath them to his Son? And if he put him not in poſſeſſion, how could he be ſaid to give them? It is a mockery, not a gift, to ſay theſe Provinces are yours, which I keep to my ſelf during life, and diſpoſe to others after my death. <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seiſin</hi> are pretty material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in ſuch conveyances, where nothing can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to paſs without them. If <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gave them, the Pope muſt have had them, and that he had them not is as plain as Hiſtory can make any thing, where it is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with uniform conſent recorded in whoſe hands theſe Weſtern Provinces were, what changes hapned from time to time, and by what means from the death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> till the Arms and favour of <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Pipin</hi> and his ſon <hi>Charles</hi> put into the Popes poſſeſſion moſt of what he has. It is known, and by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſt, that Popes during thoſe times were Subjects, at leaſt <hi>de facto,</hi> which is enough for our preſent purpoſe, there needing no more to ſhew they had not thoſe Countries which <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> is ſaid to have given to them. Not but that both he, and divers others after, and before him too, were extreamly munificent to the Church, by which munificence much Land in ſeveral places was ſetled on her by way of Alms, and actually in her poſſeſſion. But ſhe enjoy'd the revenues
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:154"/> only of thoſe Lands; Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and all Regalities were reſerv'd to the Temporal Lords. This has deceiv'd ſome, who finding mention of Poſſeſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church in former Ages, imagined they ſo belonged to her then as they do now, with entire and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſubjection. Whereas till Popes were by the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and power of the <hi>French</hi> rais'd to the ſtate of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes, the Lands of the Church were in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the eſtates of other Subjects, the immediate owners receiving the Profits, and both their Lands and Themſelves ſubject to the ſupreme Lord. They were given to other Churches as well as <hi>Rome,</hi> for maintenance of the Clergy and Poor, for the expences of buildings and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Divine Service, and that ſo plentifully, that ſome refuſed offered Patrimonies, others reſtored what they once had, not willing to be burthened with more than was needful. Theſe Lands paid publick duties as other Lands did, till the Laws exempted them: But theſe things are beſides the matter.</p>
                     <p>To return to our Argument; if the ſucceſſors of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin</hi> continued the only known Maſters of thoſe very Countries, which are ſaid to be given away; if Popes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd them for ſuch as well as the reſt of the World, and never ſo much as put in any claim, or pretended any thing to the contrary; And all this be ſo plain, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be plainer; no fiction can be more palpable, nor more wild, than this of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s <hi>Donation.</hi> It is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evident that neither Popes nor Emperours, nor any body elſe in thoſe dayes knew any thing of it.

                        <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks the pretended Charter forged by the <hi>Grecians</hi> after the tenth Age; <hi>Marca</hi> by the <hi>Latins</hi> in the time of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and by his conſent, to ſtop the mouths of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who made inſtance that the Lands recovered from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and by Him given to the Church, ſhould be reſtored to the Empire.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:154"/> the learned men even of the Popes Communion. That the <hi>Donation</hi> cannot be pretended with any ſhew of Reaſon, but in force of the Charter is plain. For 'tis next to madneſs to ſay the Weſt was given, and produce no Evidence of the Gift. Any man may claim any mans Eſtate with as much colour, and the Pope from ſuch a claim can expect no more ſucceſs than another man. But there is nothing which can be alledged in proof of this Donation, beſides this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wherefore the whole buſineſs, of which you ſeem to be jealous, is in it ſelf a pure <hi>Chimera,</hi> abſolutely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the courſe of Nature, and conſent of Hiſtory, and the only Evidence producible for it, acknowledged a forgery by our ſelves.

                        </note> Beſides he produces afterwards from the Acts of <hi>Alexander</hi> III. a clauſe of the Oath made at the concluſion of the difference, upon the death of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wherein the Kings both Father and Son are made to ſwear, <hi>That they will receive and hold the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>from the Pope, and neither they nor their ſucceſſors repute themſelves Kings of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>till the Popes</hi> for the time being, <hi>acknowledge them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have here the Cardinals word, the authority of his Acts, and the teſtimony of <hi>Petrus Bleſenſis.</hi> For the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals word, it had been more for his credit, if he had not engaged in it a manifeſt untruth. People would have been more apt to believe him in other things. It is not known more certainly that there have been <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> in this Iſland, than that the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is, and alwayes has been, Independent on any but God. Truly I grieve, and am aſhamed to ſee, Zeal to the Pope, carry it in ſuch a man, above Zeal to Truth. For thus much of his ſaying, That <hi>England is feudatory,</hi> he does indeed bring proof, ſuch as it is; but for the latter part, that <hi>every new King receiv'd Confirmation from the Pope,</hi> he does not ſo much as offer at any. And yet the buſineſs is of ſuch a nature, that the proof muſt needs be evident and obvious, if the thing were true. But the contrary is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, every body, that knows any thing of our matters, knowing that no King of <hi>England</hi> ever receiv'd Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Rome,</hi> no not King <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There was indeed this preamble, not to the Coronation Oath, as <hi>Baronius</hi> miſtakes, but to the ratification of what King <hi>Stephen</hi> had promis'd, when he was Crown'd at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> in an Aſſembly at <hi>Oxford. Ego</hi> Stephanus <hi>D. G. aſſenſu Cleri &amp; Populi in Regem</hi> Angliae <hi>electus, &amp; à</hi> Williel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Cant. <hi>Archiepiſcopo &amp; S. Rom. Eccleſiae Legato conſecratus, &amp; ab</hi> Innocentio <hi>S. Rom. Sedis Pontifice confirmatus,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this plain ſong the Cardinal deſcents in the manner before rehears'd, and might as well and as truly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Kingdom was likewiſe elective. For 'tis at leaſt true that he was elected, but it is not true that he was confirmed. The Popes Letter to the King is extant in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:155"/> 
                        <hi>Richardus Hagulſtadenſis.</hi> Confirmation is ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing there, that the word is not ſo much as mentioned. He ſays only, that <hi>ſince for avoiding the miſchiefs likely to enſue upon the death of</hi> Henry <hi>I. He had by unanimous conſent been choſen to ſucceed; He</hi> (the Pope) <hi>was well pleaſ'd with what was done, and with paternal affection receiv'd him for a ſpecial ſon of the</hi> Rom. <hi>Church, and would treat him with the ſame honour and familiarity which he had uſed to his Predeceſſor of famous memory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is far enough from Confirmation, and the language of a ſupream Lord: No State in Chriſtendom, or out of Chriſtendom, but confirms Kings, as well as the Pope, if this be confirmation. When any Prince has a flaw in his Title, He ſeeks to be acknowledged by the Neighbour Princes, and when they acknowledge, They confirm him as much as the Pope did K. <hi>Stephen.</hi> And this was plainly the caſe. <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> I. was the true Heir of the Crown. King <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf had by a ſolemn and late Oath acknowledged her right, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to maintain it. He had reaſon to colour his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as well as he could, and provide ſomething to ſay, that he might not paſs for a manifeſtly perjur'd man. And ſo he reckons up Election, and Conſecration, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, which yet altogether were not ſufficient to make him a good Title, in the judgment even of the Pope himſelf. For when K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> deſirous to ſecure the ſucceſſion to his ſon <hi>Euſtace,</hi> required the Biſhops to crown him in his own life time, they with the hazard of their lives conſtantly refus'd to do it, being forbidden by the Pope to crown the ſon of a man who had uſurped the Kingdom contrary to his Oath.</p>
                     <p>Had the Pope been thought ſupream Lord, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſary, K. <hi>Stephen</hi> muſt have had recourſe to him in the firſt place, and could not have taken the Crown till his ratification was come. But 'tis plain he was crowned before the Pope was made acquainted with the buſineſs, and before he knew how the Pope would take it, and however he had taken it, I believe would have kept the Crown which he had gotten. Indeed he thought it for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his affairs to call the Popes acknowledgment a Confirmation; but neither is there any ground in the Letter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:156"/> on which to raiſe ſuch a conſtruction; and beſides 'tis plain that 'twas not dependence of the Crown, but defect of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in himſelf, to which that Confirmation, ſuch as it was, can be applied. So that <hi>Baronius</hi> is quite out, and the worſt Commenter that ever was; it being ſo far from true, that <hi>every</hi> new King receiv'd Confirmation from <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>no one</hi> ever did it, not the very King, out of whoſe fact he ſo vainly infers all the reſt. But that the force of Prejudice is almoſt inconceivable, one would hardly believe ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and judicious a man ſhould falter in this manner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, He muſt excuſe us from taking his word in a caſe, where no body, that I know, would take the word of the Pope himſelf.</p>
                     <p>For his Acts, they are a relation of no body knows who, and that me thinks is a pleaſant Title to no leſs than a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Author is a nameleſs man, of whom it cannot be underſtood either that he was well informed of what he delivered, or faithfully delivered what he was inform'd of. Had the Cardinal reflected a little better on it, I believe he would have been more tender in expoſing ſuch proofs to a cenſorious World. Theſe unauthentick Acts are plainly contradicted by ſuch as are Authentick. <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> in his Annals has preſerv'd a Copy of the agreement made by the Popes Legates with <hi>Henry</hi> II. upon the death of S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> There the Oath is ſet down, as it was taken, which was this, <hi>That They</hi> (Father and Son) <hi>would not recede from Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>and his Catholick Succeſſors, as long as he ſhould treat them like their Anceſtors, and Catholick Kings.</hi> This was ſealed by the Kings and Legats for an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick memory of what was concluded, and this <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> himſelf has ſet down at large out of <hi>Hoveden.</hi> With <hi>Hoveden</hi> agree the other Hiſtorians neareſt thoſe times, <hi>Bromton,</hi> and <hi>Gervaſins Dorobornenſis</hi> (for the reſt mention not this particular at all) and with this agrees the relation, ſent by the Legats themſelves to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> extant in <hi>Hoveden.</hi> Againſt ſo clear an evidence to bring a nameleſs Author, is more to weaken the credit of his own proofs than ſtrengthen the Popes claim. People will be wary how they truſt Acts produc'd by <hi>Baronius,</hi> when he produces ſuch as theſe, and be convinc'd, that, if the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:156"/> Pope himſelf be infallible, all who write of him are not.</p>
                     <p>There remains <hi>Bleſenſis</hi> of whom ſo much is known, that he might poſſibly be emploid to write a letter for the King to the Pope. But that he did write this letter, and by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the King, needs ſome better proof than that it was found among his papers. It might be a rough draught, never ſent: In ſo many Copies as have been made, from the time in which he lived, till the time his works appear'd in the world, it may have been alter'd.<note place="margin">Vestrae Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones eſt Reg. <hi>Angliae</hi> &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad Feudata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii Juris obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> And indeed who conſiders what goes before, and what comes after, will ſee the two periods which concern this matter, do not well fit the place. The letter demands Counſel of the Pope, upon the undutiful carriage of his Children, whom though he could reduce by force to their duty, yet the affections of nature hindring him from that courſe, He prays the Pope to interpoſe, to whoſe arbitration he promiſes to ſtand. And this hangs pertinently together. But then to make the King ſay, that <hi>England</hi> is feudatory, and wiſh it may feel what the Pope can do, ſuits ſo ill with the reſt, that it ſeems no part of the original piece, but patcht in by ſome body elſe, and he but a botcher. For what is it to purpoſe, to mention Vaſſalage, where He only ſeeks advice? As if the Pope could give counſel to none but Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and as if it were the cuſtom of Vaſſals to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to their Lords for counſel. It is Juſtice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection which Vaſſals expect from their Lords, and this the King would have demanded of the Pope, if he had been his Subject. And then He tells him, that He has no material Arms, which is as much as to ſay, that He is not ſupreme Lord. For Soveraignty without material Arms, is no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material thing, and indeed is not Soveraignty. So that the King is made very wiſely to ſay, and unſay, with the ſame breath. Again, while He himſelf abſtains from Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, to preſs the Pope to the utmoſt rigor he can uſe, agrees very ill-favour'dly. Beſides <hi>Bleſenſis</hi> dedicates his Letters to this very King. Whoever knows any thing of his humour, and how poſitive he alwayes was in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs rights of the Crown, than its independency, will not eaſily believe he would permit ſuch a clauſe to paſs, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:157"/> much leſs become publick. He was more jealous of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than ſo. Farther, had ſuch a Letter, as is now read in <hi>Bleſenſis,</hi> been ever ſent by the King, <hi>Baronius</hi> ſure would have met with the original ſomewhere or other. For certainly the Vaſſalage of <hi>England,</hi> and Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, are things of that importance, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome more than uſual care to preſerve an Evidence ſo extraordinary, and not to truſt to chance, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of an inſignificant Copy, for ſo great, and ſo unknown an advantage of the Church. For if <hi>Bleſenſis</hi> had never been printed, the thing had never been heard of. If ſuch proofs as theſe may be hearkned to againſt Kingdoms, truly their Fate is very hard, and much worſe than of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Subject who lives in them. He that in a Suit but of 40 ſhillings ſhould produce no better, were ſure to be caſt.</p>
                     <p>I conceive there is no great neceſſity of ſaying more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſentence will alwaies be given for the Defendant, where the Proofs of the Plaintiff are inſufficient: but yet let us look into the matter a little farther, and ſee whether, this fancy of the Cardinals can be reconciled to Nature and Hiſtory. And I conſider in the firſt place, that the Tenure of Kingdoms is no private thing, to be gueſt at by incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain teſtimonies, pickt up and down among Authors of doubtful credit, but known as much as the Kingdoms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no more concealable than their forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It may as well be doubted whether they be Kingdoms or Commonwealths, as whether they be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent or no. At every death, at every change of a King, there muſt be in Vaſſals, recourſe to the ſupream Lord, his conſent required, Homage performed, Duties paid, and all publickly in the face of the world, it concerning the ſupream Lord, and he alwaies taking care that theſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations be made with the greateſt ſhew that can be. In all Treaties, in all Letters, and whatever tranſactions, the ſtile betwixt Independent Princes is different from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Lords and Vaſſals. In Competitions for the Crown, one part would alwaies fly to the ſupream Lord, and he, by his influence, make his Superiority appear. A hundred things of this nature muſt of neceſſity be regiſtred in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:157"/> records, and read in the Hiſtories which treat of our matters. <hi>Baronius</hi> little reflected on the nature of the buſineſs, when inſtead of producing Authentick Records, whereof there muſt have been many at <hi>Rome</hi> as well as here, if there had been any ſuch thing, he alledges <hi>Bleſenſis.</hi> It cannot be ſaid that the Records are loſt by Time and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. For their number, in a caſe ſo often hapning, would preſerve at leaſt ſome of them, and he has found records both more antient, and of leſs concern. Beſides Hiſtories remain ſtill. Whoever among ſo many as have writ, ever mentioned any homage done by our Kings to the Pope, or any confirmation required? Many letters are ſtill extant from the one to the other, and no hint of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in any of them. There have been many Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Crown, and none of the Pretenders ever dream't of fortifying their claims by the Influence of his ſupreme Lordſhip, though for the Influence He had as ſupreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor they deſired to make him their friend. In fine, not to inſiſt upon the ſilence of Hiſtories and Records, and want of proof in <hi>Baronius,</hi> it is evident that the Vaſſalage of a Kingdom not evidently to appear, is evidently not to be, becauſe it cannot be, without being notorious, and known to all who know the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>In the next place I would fain underſtand, when, and by whom the Kingdom could be, or rather was made, thus ſubject to the Pope. For I wave at preſent the want of power in Kings, to do ſuch a thing, if they would, and only enquire which King it was, who can be ſuppoſed to have done it. If the ſuſpition fall on the times of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> which Age and want of Writers render more obſcure, it is apparent that no Act of any King then, could be binding to the whole Nation. For no King, let him be never ſo abſolute, can bind more than his own Kingdom. But beſides, that He, who will recur to thoſe times, may indeed hide himſelf in their darkneſs, but cannot ſtrike out of them any light to his pretence, and muſt ſpeak purely out of his own head, without any warrant or colour from any other Author, ſo I think 'tis a good argument that no ſuch thing, was then done, becauſe things of leſs moment, which were done then, are remembred. The grant of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106994:158"/> by <hi>Ina</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Offa</hi> of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> is recorded too plainly, to leave a ſuſpicion that the grant of a Kingdom could be concealed. While there was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enough to take notice of ſingle pence, the Crown ſure could not paſs by unregarded. If any man fancy want of fidelity in our Hiſtorians, might poſſibly ſuppreſs ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful a Truth, let him produce thoſe more faithful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who have recorded it. But conſidering the Zeal of thoſe times, and mighty opinion they had of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the greateſt Kings frequently became Pilgrims, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times left their Kingdoms wholly, and became Monks there, the ſuſpicion lyes on the other ſide, it being more rational to fancy an amplification than ſuppreſſion of things to their advantage. However ſuch an Alms as a Kingdom could not but make a noiſe, loud enough to reach even our ears, and had the <hi>Romescot</hi> charity been extended to the Regalities, we muſt have heard of it, as well as of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes. By the way, I am not ignorant what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made on that Alms, but I think it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to loſe time in confuting them. 'Tis to give them more credit than they deſerve; for he enhances the value of Trifles, who treats them like things of moment.</p>
                     <p>The memory of paſſages ſince the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> is too freſh, and too minute to leave place for ſuſpicion, that a matter of ſuch moment ſhould ſcape unobſerved. And beſides there is among the Works of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> a Letter of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. which puts the matter out of doubt. That Pope had the confidence to demand of that King an acknowledgment of ſubjection, <hi>Fidelitatem</hi> or <hi>Fealty,</hi> as the phraſe runs; I know not upon what ground. For though I have read ſomewhere, that the Conquerour, to gain the Pope to his ſide when he attempted the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, promis'd, in caſe of ſucceſs, to hold the Kingdom of the Pope,<note place="margin">Ep. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc.</hi> VII.</note> yet it appears by the Kings anſwer, that he was miſtaken who ſaid ſo. <hi>Fidelitatem facere nolui, nec volo,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>quia nec ego promiſi, nec Anteceſſores meos, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teceſſoribus tuis id feciſſe comperio.</hi> So that till the Conqueſt <hi>England</hi> was free, and that it became ſubject ſince, ſure no body will imagin. The firſt Kings of the <hi>Norman</hi> race were men of too great ſpirits, and conteſted with the Pope,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:158"/> about matters of leſs importance too warmly, to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of giving away their Kingdoms. He that reflects what buſtles there were about <hi>Inveſtitures</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> I. and <hi>Immunities</hi> of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> II. will find it neither likely nor poſſible the greateſt rights of the Crown ſhould be thrown away, while Princes were ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of the leſs. It is true that both theſe Kings yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt to the Pope, but with a condeſcendence ſo far from any ſign of ſubjection, that there was more of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, than ſubſtance in the firſt caſe, and a great deal of caution in the ſecond, no ſubjection nor ſhew of any in either.</p>
                     <p>The Contraſt between <hi>Henry</hi> I. and the Pope was about <hi>Inveſtitures,</hi> the King deſirous to continue the cuſtom of ratifying the election of Biſhops and Abbots, by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ring and Staff to the Elect, and the Pope reſolv'd to break it. The concluſion was that the Ceremony ſhould no more be uſed, but ſo that the King ſhould chuſe, or cauſe to be choſen the perſon, and receive homage from him that was choſen. <hi>Inveſtituram Annuli &amp; Baculi indulſit in perpetuum, retento tamen electionis &amp; regalium privilegio,</hi> ſays <hi>Will.

For while They had the chief influence in elections, and none could be promoted but by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition, the reſt was a Ceremony, which might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great prejudice, be left off. Again, when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Elect were by homage to acknowledg themſelves Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Princes, they had as much as they deſir'd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed till this point was yielded by the Pope (for it was a while ſtifly ſtood upon) no agreement could be made. But after, Peace ſoon followed.</p>
                     <p>The quarrel of <hi>Henry</hi> II. was about the Cuſtoms of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi> in which the chief point was that of <hi>Appeals.</hi> This point the Pope gain'd of the King, yet with this caution, that the Appellant ſhould give ſecurity to attempt nothing to the prejudice of King or Kingdom. It was now a time,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:159"/> if ever, for the Popes ſupreme Lordſhip to appear. He was in the humour of aſſerting, at leaſt, all that belong'd to him. The World was incens'd againſt the King for the foulneſs of the late murther, and ready to take the Popes part. The King found it neceſſary to buy his peace, even at the rate of pretenſions very dear to him, and for which he had long and earneſtly contended. Had the Pope been ſupreme Lord, he would hardly have ſcaped ſo good cheap. Murther and Sacriledge might have coſt him the whole Kingdom. For feudatory Lands are forfeited by great crimes. However this ſupreme Dominion muſt needs have appeared in the tranſaction. The King was not in caſe to refuſe any thing due to the Pope, who yielded up what till then he thought not due; and beſides the tenor of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt have been quite different, and drawn in terms us'd betwixt Vaſſals and Lords. But inſtead of an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this nature, all the diſadvantage the King had in treating, could not prevail with him to acknowledg the Pope ſo much as Pope, longer than the Pope ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and treat him as King. So that by the favour of the Cardinals <hi>Acts,</hi> this King left the Crown as free as he found it, nor can the King be yet found out on whom the ſuſpicion ſhould fall, of having made it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>If I am not much miſtaken, the Popes in thoſe daies were of a judgment very different from that which <hi>Baronius</hi> has taken up in ours. For how can the conceit of a Vaſſalage in the time of this King conſiſt with what hapned a little after in the reign of K. <hi>John?</hi> Neither could K. <hi>John</hi> make <hi>England</hi> tributary, if it were ſo before, neither could the Pope deſire he ſhould. Beſides diſobedience in a Vaſſal, and, what is more ſtubborn contraſting with a ſupream Lord, eſpecially when that ſupream Lord is the Pope, would ſure have been thought as great a crime, as refuſing an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop made without his privity and againſt his will. Why was not this laid to the Kings charge and called Rebellion? When the ſeverity of the proceedings againſt him, perhaps needed all the colour, which could be laid on. Without all doubt, the Pope when he had the King at his mercy, would never have been contented, with the bare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:159"/> of ſubjection, if he had known ſubjection was due before. He had proſecuted the King to the utmoſt extremity: Interdicted the Kingdom; excommunicated his Perſon; and at laſt depoſed, and ſet the power of <hi>France</hi> upon him. It is not poſſible he ſhould take for ſufficient ſatisfaction for faults, which in his judgment deſerved all this rigor, a confeſſion that his own was his own, and a gift of what was his before. But the Kings reſignation made amends for all, and cleared ſcores ſo fully, that the Pope ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was faſt to him, and heartily took his part in all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. Then and not before, Popes aſſumed the liberty to term the Kings of <hi>England</hi> their <hi>Vaſſals;</hi> which is a plain acknowledgment that they underſtood this ſubmiſſion, and nothing elſe, authoriz'd them ſo to do. Agreeable to this were the outcries remembred by <hi>M. Paris, Heu Anglia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ad an. <hi>1216.</hi>

                     <p>To conclude, commend me to this fiction of <hi>Baronius</hi> for an example of zeal not according to knowledge. To ſpeak without proof in a matter of this conſequence, is pretty well of it ſelf. But to want proof where the nature of the thing muſt needs afford a thouſand; to fancy the Tenure of a Kingdome, could lie conceal'd I know not how long, and at laſt be diſcovered by his either pains or luck, to be quite contrary to what was apprehended by the reſt of the world, which could no more be ignorant of the Tenure than of the Kingdom; to imagine <hi>England</hi> ſubject when no perſon can be imagined who ſhould ſubject it, nor time in which it ſhould become ſubject; to ſay nothing of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold inconſiſtency of his ſtory, and contradiction to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable evidence. Theſe are ſtrains which as I admire in him, ſo I hope not often to find elſewhere. And for <hi>Bleſenſis,</hi> either he knew not what he ſaid, or, which is more likely, thoſe two periods have by chance or fraud crept into his writings without his privity. In fine, he is no good <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who does not acknowledge <hi>that the Kingdom of England

                     <p>And ſo we are come at laſt to the point of greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, both of its own nature, and by the ſmartneſs with which 'tis preſt, the Fact of K. <hi>John.</hi> Our Author, not to leave the wound he makes without cure, aſſigns us <hi>Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> for a remedy. You have not an entire confidence in this plaiſter, and I muſt confeſs I cannot blame you; not that I think it bad, but I like better to be ſound, and need none. Moſt points of Law, and this of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> as well as the reſt, are full of learned Quibbles, and I do not love to truſt our ſecurity to a <hi>moot caſe.</hi> The rights of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are of too great conſequence to depend on the <hi>Tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum de Lege.</hi> For what if ſome fiction of Law be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt our <hi>Preſcription?</hi> What if the Pope, by ſome Act or other of which we never had intelligence, have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a <hi>Legal,</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> poſſeſſion, all the time of our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> poſſeſſion, and ſo interrupted or voided our <hi>Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption?</hi> It is not ſafe, in my opinion, to venture our whole ſtock in a bottom which poſſibly may prove leaky. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Preſcription</hi> may do well enough, yet while we have, in my judgment, a better game to play, I think it beſt, as you ſay, to play ſurer.</p>
                     <p>Of the Conſiderations propos'd in this matter with great ſharpneſs by our Author, I take theſe to be the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. That K. <hi>John</hi> paſt this grant <hi>when he had undoubted right to the Crown without any Competitor,</hi> his Nephew <hi>Arthur</hi> being dead before: That this right of his was then uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, <hi>Magna Charta not being yet framed, nor any power commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Barons, or People, or Parliaments, for intermedling in the ſucceſſion:</hi> And that however the <hi>Deed was confirmed by his Barons, who were they alone that then had any thing to do in the greater affairs of State.</hi> On theſe, becauſe they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Queſtion, I ſhall inſiſt more largely, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew He is miſtaken in all three.</p>
                     <p>Firſt for the conſent of the Barons, although this clauſe <hi>Communi Conſilio Baronum noſtrorum</hi> be inſerted in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet nothing can be more apparent, than that in truth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:160"/> there was no ſuch thing. It was ſo far from this, that there was an expreſs diſſent.<note place="margin">Cui etiam manifeſte contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum fuit, &amp; ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatis Regni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatum, quid talia nullo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do facere potuiſſet per os ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilis <hi>Stephani Can.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, quo non erat tunc major in Regno, <hi>&amp;c.

                        </note> For <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> proteſted ſolemnly againſt it, and this publickly at the high Altar before all the company, and in the name of the whole Kingdom. This proteſtation of his was averred to the Popes face, and that in full Council, by <hi>Will. Povick</hi> or <hi>Powevick,</hi> one of the Embaſſadors at the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither he was ſent to complain in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Kingdom. I think it will not be denied, but the Clergy in thoſe dayes had at leaſt as much influence on publick affairs, as the reſt of the Nobility; and that there could be no common conſent, where the Head of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy publickly diſſented. Eſpecially conſidering that this proteſtation was not made for himſelf only, or his Order, but in the name of the whole Kingdom. For it can hardly be, that he ſhould arrogate to himſelf to act in the name of the Kingdom, without the privity of the reſt, and conſent of ſo many at leaſt as might keep his Act from appearing ridiculous. But that the reſt of the Nobility were as far from conſenting as the Clergy, is not left to gueſs. Their ſenſe is manifeſt in the next words of <hi>Povick, In quod tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nunquam Patres noſtri conſenſerunt, nec aliquo tempore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentient,</hi> as <hi>Mat. Weſtm.</hi> relates them, or according to <hi>Mat. Paris, In quod nunquam Patres nobilium Regni, vel ipſi conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerunt, nec conſentiunt, neque in futurum conſentient,</hi> &amp;c. This was ſaid in circumſtances uncapable of the ſuſpition of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The man who ſpoke was an Embaſſador, commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to ſpeak for the Kingdom. He ſpoke to the Pope himſelf, in a full Council, and while the memory of things was yet freſh, and if he had not ſaid true, might have been convinc'd by every body perhaps in the company. But neither the Pope himſelf, who certainly knew the truth, and was moſt concern'd in it, nor any body elſe had anything to ſay againſt it. Beſides even in the daies of K. <hi>John,</hi> the K. of <hi>France,</hi> and his Son <hi>Lewis,</hi> when <hi>Walo</hi> the Popes Legat would have diverted them from their deſign on <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by repreſenting that the Kingdom held now of the Pope, maintained both to his face,<note place="margin">M. Paris <hi>ad an.</hi> 1216.</note> that K. <hi>Johns</hi> grant was void, and this among other things, becauſe <hi>there was no conſent of the Barons.</hi> It is not poſſible they ſhould ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106994:161"/> avouch this to one who could not but know the truth, unleſs it had been notorious and undeniable even by <hi>Walo</hi> himſelf. Wherefore, it is manifeſt that the clauſe above mentioned was inſerted for forms ſake, without truth, it being not more known that there was a Charter, than that it was made without the conſent of the Nobility. What the conſequence of this is, will fall into conſideration by and by, when we have diſcours'd of what remains.</p>
                     <p>The next point is, that K. <hi>John had an undoubted right to the Crown when He paſt this Deed.</hi> Suppoſe he had, what then? Right to wear the Crown, and Right to give it away, are very different things, and very far from inferring one another. He urges, that <hi>the Regal power in diſpoſing of the Crown was the ſame then, as at the conqueſt.</hi> That <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror both receiv'd the Crown by gift from K.</hi> Edward, <hi>and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of it by Teſtament.</hi> That <hi>although K.</hi> Edwards <hi>gift ſhould paſs for invalid, yet the very title of Conqueſt was ſufficient for an Arbitrary power of diſpoſing it, the very grant of</hi> Magna Charta <hi>from the Prince to the People being a plain Argument, that at leaſt the power of our</hi> Norman <hi>Princes was originally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and unconfined, till themſelves were pleas'd to reſtrain it by voluntary compacts, and conceſſions,</hi> which hapned not till after the fact in queſtion. Thus does our Author diſcourſe, with a Tide of ſmartneſs, threaten Shipwrack to our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which way ſoever we ſteer. To deny an arbitrary right in the Conqueror, ſeems to queſtion the <hi>right</hi> of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: To grant it, ſeems to confirm the <hi>Deed</hi> in queſtion, and expoſe us to the mercy of the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Before I anſwer particularly, I take leave to ſuppoſe, not becauſe it cannot be prov'd, but becauſe no body will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire proof of what every body acknowledges, That rights queſtionable in their origin become unqueſtionable in tract of time. The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> broke into the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and maſtered a great part of it with a known violence, but unknown Juſtice. Should ear be given to the exceptions which might be made againſt their Title, and the right of their poſterity, and all who hold under them, queſtioned till the right of the firſt occupants were clearly made out, the world would be embroyled in inextricable confuſion, and ſuffer little leſs from our diſputes than their Arms.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106994:161"/> Few either Princes or private men, would enjoy their Eſtates with a ſafe Conſcience. The bonds of Obedience would be broken, the ſecurity of Life and Fortunes taken away, and the Ligaments of human ſociety diſſolv'd. Theſe things are ſo evidently contrary to the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that ſpeculations, which would infer them, are evidently contrary to reaſon. Speculate what you will of Juſtice, it is moſt certain that to ruin the world is a moſt unjuſt thing; or, if you will criticize upon the notion, at leaſt irrational, and wicked, and intollerable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever were the origin of eſtabliſh't Powers, when they are eſtabliſh't, and by long continuance become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the quiet and ſecurity of mankind, they are moſt certainly juſt, and to queſtion them is madneſs in all, and Treaſon in Subjects. To examin by what means this comes to paſs, how true Right is acquired in Time, and even bad Titles become good at laſt, I conceive an Argument too high for me, and beſides ſee it needleſs to meddle with it. For while the thing is univerſally acknowledged, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deni'd without extream miſchief to the world, the labour of enquiring more particularly into it, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenc'd with. Two things I take to my preſent purpoſe, which I ſuppoſe none will deny me. 1. That the Right of ſucceeding Kings cannot be queſtioned on pretence of doubt, nay if you will, defect of <hi>right</hi> in the proceedings of ſuch as have reign'd ſo long ſince as the Conqueſt. 2. That <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> being manifeſtly two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, it follows not, that becauſe things were then done which ought not be queſtioned now, I mean with prejudice to Poſterity, that they were therefore well done, and according to <hi>Right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſpeak now particularly to what is alledged, It is true that the <hi>Conqueror</hi> had, or pretended a Gift from K. <hi>Edward,</hi> I ſuppoſe to have ſomething to ſay. But 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that, not K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s gift, but his own ſword gain'd him <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Ratio ultima Regum</hi> was his only unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Argument, and had <hi>Harold</hi> got the Victory, and preſerv'd the Kingdom, he would have preſerved <hi>Right</hi> enough to it, notwithſtanding the Gift of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> and as much <hi>right</hi> been acknowledg'd in his Succeſſors, as now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:162"/> in thoſe of the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> It is true alſo that the <hi>Conqueror</hi> did diſpoſe of the Kingdom to the prejudice of his eldeſt Son; but 'tis likewiſe true, that Duke <hi>Robert</hi> did claim, and put for the Crown, notwithſtanding his Fathers Teſtament, and had he prevailed, had tranſmitted a Right to his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which by this time had been unqueſtionable. Theſe are matters purely of <hi>Fact,</hi> of which kind there are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Hiſtory, but from which, according to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im that <hi>Fact does not infer Right,</hi> no Argument can be drawn. What the <hi>Conqueror</hi> did, He did by the power which his Conqueſt gave him; ſucceſs and length of time has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't, what depends on his actions, into a firmneſs which admits of no diſpute. But this concludes not that all he did was juſt even in him, and much leſs that the ſame Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are juſtifiable in his Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p>As for what is next urged, <hi>That Conqueſt ſufficed for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power,</hi> it is undoubtedly true; for he did arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe of things as he pleaſed. But that his Conqueſt gave him Right ſo to do, or tranſmitted ſuch a Right to his Poſterity, is not to be admitted without very good proof. It is univerſally agreed that Conqueſt gives right only where the War is juſt; which I think ſignifies, that his Conqueſt gave him none at all. For the War is not juſt, unleſs he have a good Title who makes it, and if he have, Conqueſt only puts him into poſſeſſion of what was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with-held, but his Right is antecedent to, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of his Conqueſt. Indeed where the revenge of ſome collateral wrong, or other cauſe, put juſt Arms into the hands of any Prince, there what he gains is thought juſtly his own, by vertue of his Conqueſt. But this is not our caſe. The only cauſe of this War, was becauſe <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> with-held the Crown, to which if the <hi>Conqueror</hi> had a juſt Title, that which made it ſo gave him his <hi>Right;</hi> if he had not, the War was not juſt, and Conqueſt could give him none. Whether his Title were good or no, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute in which I am not concern'd, it not importing much to our times to know what was juſt in thoſe. For whether his Title were juſt, that of his preſent Succeſſors is not a jot the better, nor a jot the worſe, if it were ſtark naught. Wherefore I poſitively deny the Inference imply'd in our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:162"/> Author's diſcourſe, the Conqueror did arbitrarily diſpoſe of the Kingdom, therefore K. <hi>John</hi> juſtly might, becauſe that Arbitrarineſs of his does not conclude he had <hi>Right,</hi> ſo much as to the Crown, and much leſs to diſpoſe as he pleas'd of it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis farther urged, That <hi>the very granting of Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta from the Prince to the People, is a plain Argument, that at leaſt the power of our</hi> Norman <hi>Princes was originally arbitrary, and unconfin'd, till themſelves were pleas'd to restrain it by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary compacts and conceſſions.</hi> And this, as the former, is true of <hi>Power,</hi> but I cannot grant it of <hi>Right.</hi> The Fact is interpretable both ways, and may as well argue <hi>Right</hi> in the People to the things granted, as in Princes to grant them. And if Juſtice required that ſuch things ſhould be granted, the Power, which till the grants were paſt, hindred the People from what it was fit they ſhould have, can hardly be thought juſt. The Truth is, this difficulty would ask rather a Treatiſe, than a Letter. The Notions of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> would be explained and ſetled: It would be ſhewn how <hi>Right</hi> is acquired, and how loſt: How the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Nature is changed into ſubjection; why, and how far, ſome command, others obey, and in vertue of what, with twenty other Conſiderations, neceſſary enough to clear the difficulty, as it ought, but too long for a Packet.</p>
                     <p>To ſay briefly as much as may ſerve turn; I obſerve that we uſe theſe words <hi>Juſt</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> as all others, in different ſenſes. We call him a Juſt man, who gives to every one what the Law makes his due, in which ſenſe the Law is the Rule of <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt; Juſt</hi> meaning as much as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> the ſame as contrary, to Law. But ſometimes we apply the ſame Terms to Laws themſelves, and ſay ſome are Juſt, others Unjuſt. As if Marriage, or the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poſterity, were univerſally forbidden, or every body commanded to cut off their Legs or Arms, ſuch Laws would be thought, and called Unjuſt. In this caſe the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe words is very different, from what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Unjuſtice now ſignifying oppoſition, not to Law, which cannot be oppoſite to it ſelf, but to ſomething elſe, which the Law-makers had in their eye, when they made a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:163"/> juſt Law, and which was their Rule, and directed them to order what they did, and not the contrary. If we reflect what this is, we ſhall find that <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> are ſaid with reference to the nature of man. For other things being made for his uſe, are not alwayes to be dealt with, as is moſt fitting for them, but as they may beſt ſerve him. But man muſt be uſed as his nature requires, and if he be not, we ſay he is wronged. I conceive therefore that the Root of Juſtice lyes in the nature of man, and that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is fitting, or unfit for it, is the original Rule of Juſt and Unjuſt. To deſcend to more particulars, and diſpute how far one man may juſtly be hindred from his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good, for the greater good of the ſociety in which he lives, with the reſt of the Conſiderations which belong to Law-makers, is not to my purpoſe. It is enough if I obſerve that <hi>Just</hi> ſignifies <hi>radically</hi> Commenſurate, or Fit, <hi>generally</hi> implies Agreement, which Agreement is ſuppoſed to be made on ſight of what is fit for both parties agreeing. So that antecedently to Laws, which are, and ought to be in practice, at leaſt betwixt members of the ſame common-wealth, look't on as the only Rules of Juſtice, there is a proportion or exigence of Nature, with reſpect to which ſome things are Juſt, others Unjuſt, and to which when Laws have not an eye, they themſelves are thought not Juſt. And this explication I take to be, not only true, but univerſally acknowledged. For if poſitive agreements be thought abſolutely neceſſary to the notion of Juſtice, I know not how that notion can be found in the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations, which are the higheſt and moſt binding of all others, and yet are before, and manifeſtly without agreements.</p>
                     <p>To apply this to our caſe, I conſider that Government has been embrac'd for the good of the world, to avoid the miſchief of lawleſs humors deſtructive to ſociety, and that the Good of the Commonwealth is, or ought to be, the Princes Rule, from which when he ſwerves, his Action is not Juſt, becauſe unproportioned, and not ſuited to that exigence of Nature which is the root of Juſtice: yet it does not follow that a Prince every time he does unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may be reſiſted. That is another, and at preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning Queſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:163"/>
                     <p>I conſider farther that nothing can more import the good of the Commonwealth than the Governors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For they are the main hinges on which the common good turns, and the Fountains from which all goods flow to particulars. If theſe be ſuch as may endanger long ſetled Laws, and Cuſtoms, and render the properties of ſubjects uncertain, and unſecure, the Commonwealth alwaies tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and often falls. But all this will unavoidably follow, if the nomination of ſupream Governors be left to arbitrary pleaſure. They may be ſtrangers, and through ignorance unable to preſerve national Laws, They may be enemies, and through ill affection ſtudious to break them. In fine, to fancy that any thing can be more againſt the common good, than to want known rules of ſucceſſion, and that a Nation ſhould be bound to obey whoever is named by chance or humor, is to fancy there may be ſome member more conſiderable to the Body than the Head.</p>
                     <p>If this diſcourſe be good, it may be underſtood how the Arbitrary power even of Conquerors, may be bounded, otherwiſe than by their voluntary Compacts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, namely by nature, and by the proportion of their Actions to the ſubject on which they Act. It is true that antecedently to compacts, their Actions cannot be called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> as <hi>unjuſt</hi> ſignifies breach of agreements: but as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust</hi> ſignifies breach of proportion, and the violation of what nature requires, They may be unjuſt, even before they bind themſelves by compact to obſerve this proportion. This now I concieve is our Caſe, and that, ſince the good of the Commonwealth is the Rule of the Princes Action, and that 'tis plainly againſt that good that their ſupream Governors ſhould be appointed arbitrarily, the arbitrary diſpoſitions of the Crown, mentioned by our Author were effects more of <hi>Power</hi> than <hi>Right.</hi> I think himſelf will grant, if thoſe <hi>Norman</hi> Princes were unconfin'd, till they voluntarily confin'd themſelves, that 'twas at leaſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and fit they ſhould be confin'd in this point; and ſure, a Power to act unreaſonably, and unfitly, is not what the world means by <hi>Right. Right</hi> to do ill, ſounds very like <hi>Right</hi> to do wrong, and is in this caſe neither better nor worſe. For if arbitrary placing of Governors be againſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:164"/> the good of the Commonwealth, and <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Juſt</hi> ſignify as much as Fit, or Good, and that, as at preſent it muſt, with reſpect to the Commonwealth, there is a <hi>Right</hi> in the Commonwealth which requires their Princes ſhould not be ſet over them arbitrarily, and thoſe arbitrary diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Crown were manifeſtly againſt <hi>Right.</hi> And yet perhaps it is enough that they were unreaſonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For unreaſonable Actions are no more to be drawn into conſequence than unjuſt ones, and peradventure bind no more, where collateral conſiderations do not give them a ſtrength, which they have not of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I have alledged theſe conſiderations more to hint what may be ſaid, than becauſe I think nothing elſe can. For after all, it may with truth be maintained, that the power of the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> Princes, and of the Conqueror him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as the reſt, was actually confined, and in the manner our Author would have it, by voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, long before <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of thoſe liberties to the ſubject, which he ſuppoſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it now. They all took Oaths at their Coronation, and bound themſelves to the obſervation of Juſtice. If an Oath do not bind a Prince, an Oath deliberately and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made in the face of God and Man, in a matter too mainly concerning the good of the Commonwealth, for whoſe ſecurity he gives that Oath, and which ſhe accepts as full ſecurity, there is no talking of Confinement upon him, of ſecurity to a Commonwealth, of Laws, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and Compacts, but all muſt be left to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unconfin'd pleaſure of one man; a Poſition, which, is the Freedom of this part of the world, I ſuppoſe will not find much entertainment. However it is the ſtrength even of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, which cannot confine a Prince, if his Oath do not firſt confine him to obſerve it. Now who ſwears to render Juſtice, undoubtedly ſwears to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Juſtice to the Kingdom in the firſt place. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the whole, is the concern of all particulars, every one being as much, and perhaps more, intereſted in the Rights of the Kingdom, than in his private pretenſions. If any man doubt of this, I ſuppoſe no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> at leaſt will doubt but that he is to acquieſce to the Judgment of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:164"/> Parliament. And it is poſitively declared by Parliament,<note place="margin">40 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3</note> that the Fact of K. <hi>John</hi> was contrary to his Coronation Oath, in which nevertheleſs for ought I can find, there is nothing more, than general expreſſions of rendring Juſtice. However it be, ſince it is a judged caſe, that K. <hi>John</hi> broke his Oath, in his arbitrary diſpoſition of the Kingdom, it is a judged caſe, that his Power was confined in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and this independently of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all ſubſequent Compacts. And if his, then ſure of all the reſt, for they all ſwear as much as He.</p>
                     <p>But if any man will continue ſtiff in this opinion, and believe nothing able to confine the arbitrary power of Conquerors but their own Conceſſions, I would entreat him to direct me to that Conceſſion which has confin'd their power in this point, beſides their Coronation Oath. I do not find either in <hi>Mag. Charta,</hi> or any where elſe, any Article concerning the diſpoſition of the Crown. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eder men may know more, but my Ignorance perſwades me, that if the <hi>Norman</hi> Princes had ſuch a Right, and that Right can only be reſtrained by voluntary Conceſſions, and thoſe direct to the point, their Succeſſors have it ſtill. And 'tis not eaſie to be perſwaded otherwiſe, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion appear. But this no Engliſhman can either ſay or think, nothing being more notorious than that it cannot be done now. Whoever will take the pains to examin how it comes to paſs, that this original power is now reſtrained, will not eaſily be ſatisfi'd, if nothing elſe will ſatisfie him but a direct Conceſſion. I believe he will be forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs at laſt, that ſuch a Conceſſion is neither extant, nor needful, and acknowledg that Power is bounded as truly and as ſtrongly by Nature as Grants.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole I conceive there may in the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> Princes be conſidered the Power of Conquerors, and Right of Kings. That their Power was unconfin'd enough, but ought not be drawn into Precedent, although it be againſt all Reaſon and Juſtice to queſtion now thoſe effects of their Power, which remain among us even to this day. For theſe have ſtrength, not from their Power, but from what is able to turn Unjuſt into Juſt, as Titles, originally bad, become good in proceſs of Time. That even their Right
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106994:165"/> was confined, the very notion of Right implying limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For right ſignifies proportion of the Action to the ſubject, ſo that an unconfined Right is not Right. That their Right was confined in this particular by the good of the Kingdom, as has been diſcours'd before; and though it had not Right to what they did is very far from infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Right to what K. <hi>John</hi> did: the two remarkable prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, mentioned by our Author, being ſo remarkably dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this caſe, that they can be no Precedents, nor warrant for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Rufus</hi> reigned after his Father, and excluded his Brother, in truth by the favour of the Kingdom, yet claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Fathers Teſtament. That claim may be allow'd, without allowing King <hi>Johns</hi> reſignation. For in the Conquerors fact there was no more, then of two ſons, both fit, both equal to the Kingdom, to prefer whom he thought fitteſt. The Laws and Liberties, and condition of the Kingdom was the ſame under either; ſo that apprehending in likelyhood no greater intereſt in the buſineſs than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their King ſhould be called <hi>William,</hi> or <hi>Robert,</hi> They approved the Fathers choice, and willingly obey'd whom he appointed. But King <hi>John's</hi> Fact was quite of another ſtrain, A Stranger, and ſuch an one who could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a denizen, one taken up with other cares, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling too far off, to be ever able to act as was fitting, for the good of <hi>England,</hi> was made the ſupream Lord; and which was worſe, the Tenure of the Kingdom altered, and of free turn'd into ſubject. The Kingdom was ſenſible of their Intereſt in the buſineſs, and diſclaim'd the fact, both then and ever ſince. I am miſtaken if Reception of Laws, be not generally held a very material conſideration to their validity. But the caſes are otherwiſe ſo apparently different, that a Right in the Conqueror, to diſpoſe of the Crown as he did, may ſafely be granted, without any neceſſity, or colour, of allowing in conſequence a Right to King <hi>John</hi> to diſpoſe of it as he did.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Henry</hi> 1. ſucceeded in vertue of the ſame Teſtament, his caſe is the ſame with the former. But this Gentlemans information was better than mine if he had other Title than Election, at leaſt till his Brother conſented, as he ſoon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106994:165"/> did, the ſame title which K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and after him K. <hi>John</hi> had to the Crown. I ſhould think their Examples a very good Reaſon, that the proceedings of thoſe times are not to be drawn into conſequence. For if they may, it will follow that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> perhaps is, at leaſt has been <hi>Elective.</hi> Which I ſuppoſe no Engliſhman will admit: if they may not, I know not to what purpoſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                     <p>For theſe reaſons I am perſwaded nothing can be drawn from the proceedings of the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> Princes to juſtify the <hi>Reſignation</hi> of King <hi>John,</hi> which is ſo far from being bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our times, that it never had any validity at all. But not to leave the matter diſputable betwixt my No, and the Yea of who will maintain the contrary, I will fairly put it to Judgment, and ſay, whatever was done, and by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever right, about the times of the Conqueſt, that K. <hi>John</hi> in particular could not validly do what he did; and that this has already been decided, and in ſuch manner, that there is nothing ſo firmly ſetled in the world, which may not admit of queſtion as well as this. In the reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> III. the Pope demanded the long unpaid one thouſand marks granted by K. <hi>John,</hi> and threatned by legal proceſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this rent. A Parliament was called chiefly for this buſineſs, and it was unanimouſly reſolv'd,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi> 40 Ed. 3.</note> That <hi>neither K.</hi> John, <hi>nor any other, could bring Himſelf, his Kingdom, or People into ſuch ſubjection, without their conſent, and againſt his Coronation Oath. And that in caſe the Pope ſhould by proceſs or otherwiſe, attempt to conſtrain the King or his Subjects to perform the premiſſes, They would become Parties, and reſiſt him with all their Power.</hi> This is plain and peremptory, and directly to the point. I cannot but muſe to obſerve them ſpeak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of the matter of Fact,<note place="margin">Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls.</note> and the more becauſe Sr. <hi>Tho. More</hi> very poſitively denies the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could in his, or any time, produce ſuch an Evidence. When I conſider He was a learned man, and no Enemy to the Pope, had great means of being well acquainted with Records, and paſſages of former times unknown to others, and ſpeaks as if he had good ground for what he ſaid, I hardly know what to think of it. I wiſh he had inform'd us what his grounds were; peradventure there is more to be ſaid than
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106994:166"/> we are aware of. But ſince he has not, and the Parliament does not directly deny the <hi>Fact,</hi> I for my part muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to take things at the worſt, and not deny what I cannot diſprove. I have this for my comfort, that if the <hi>Fact</hi> were true, it was in Sr. <hi>Tho. More</hi>'s words, <hi>right naught worth,</hi> and the Authority of Parliament to bear me out. By the way our Author in alledging the conſent of the Barons, at that time the only repreſentative of the Kingdom, ſpeaks againſt a ſolemn Declaration of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this undeniable proof may be joyned to what I produc'd before, to make good my denial of their conſent. However the Queſtion is poſitively decided, and by an Authority irrefragable to Engliſhmen.</p>
                     <p>But leſt we ſhould be ſuſpected of partiality in our own caſe; let us put it to the Judgment of Forreigners. When the differences betwixt this King and the Barons became irreconcileable, they ſought protection from <hi>France.</hi> The Pope ſent a Legat to diſſwade the <hi>French</hi> King and his Son from medling with a Kingdom, the Dominion whereof belonged now to the Church. The word was hardly out of the Legats mouth, when the King of <hi>France</hi> reply'd ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">M. Paris <hi>ad an.</hi> 1216.</note> That <hi>England never had been, nor then was, nor ever ſhould be the Patrimony of</hi> Peter. And this, beſides what he elſe alledged, becauſe <hi>no King could give away his Kingdom without conſent of his Barons, an error which if the Pope would maintain; He would give a moſt pernicious example to all Kingdoms:</hi> The Nobility preſent with great heat juſtify'd this ſpeech of their King, and <hi>declared they would ſtand for</hi> that point to death, <hi>viz. that it was not in the power of any King to transfer his Kingdom, or make it tributary at pleaſure.</hi> You ſee I ſpoke not altogether out of my own head, when I refus'd to yield an arbitrary right of diſpoſing Kingdoms even to Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and that I ſhall not want who will take my part. But to let that paſs, it cannot be attributed to the partiality of our either Country or Times, that we hold this Deed of K. <hi>John</hi> null, when it was condemned for ſuch by thoſe who were contemporaries to it, and as much abroad as at home. Who deſires more ſecurity is in my opinion a very ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous man.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding let us put it to the Judgment of the very
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106994:166"/> Contrivers of the Deed. I am much miſtaken if Themſelves had not the ſame ſentiments with the reſt of the world. If They did not underſtand well enough, that the conſent of the Barons was neceſſary to the validity of the Deed, why did they inſert that clauſe, <hi>Communi Conſilio Baronum noſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum?</hi> A thing of this conſequence undoubtedly was not careleſly hudled up. Great deliberation was without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion us'd, and they would never have put in, what they themſelves and every body elſe knew was falſe, but that they were ſenſible All was to no purpoſe without it. So that, in the hard choice of framing a Draught, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Truth, or without validity, They had an eye to the latter, and let the firſt ſhift as it could. The truth is, They had reaſon; it being obvious enough, that if they could carry things out at preſent, the <hi>Charter</hi> it ſelf, as all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords are, would be a ſtrong Preſumption, for the truth of what it contains, to Poſterity. But ſince it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as that there was a <hi>Charter,</hi> that this Clauſe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, it is likewiſe evident, that Thoſe who put it in, thought it neceſſary. Wherefore even in their Judgments the Grant was invalid, as wanting what themſelves thought abſolutely requiſite.</p>
                     <p>You now perceive of what importance this point is, of the Conſent of the Barons, of which I forbore to ſpeak, while I was examining whether they conſented or no. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I mean to dilate upon it now: it being enough to obſerve, that the want of it abſolutely invalidates the Grant, and this in the Judgment, not only of the Framers, and of the King and Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> but of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For you ſee They poſitively declare, that neither K. <hi>John,</hi> nor any other could bring the Kingdom into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, without conſent of the People, who at that time had none, but the Barons, to conſent for them. So that not to acquieſce in this point, is to refuſe the higheſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Nation; and who does ſo is not fit to live in the Nation.</p>
                     <p>But ſhall I venture to joyn our Author himſelf to the reſt of this good company, and ſay, that whatever out of the ſtrength of his wit He alledges on the other ſide, yet this <hi>Charter</hi> is no more valid in his judgment, than in other folks?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106994:167"/> And I do not mean that 'tis become now invalid, by the force of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> (for this he has ſufficiently declared) but that it was originally and always invalid. Truly I am miſtaken if this may not be concluded from what he ſays elſewhere, when diſ-engaged from the deſire of making good his Argument, he frankly diſcovers his true ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Pag. 239. conſidering an obſervation made in a former Letter, on the particular <hi>Fact</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> he replies, That <hi>whether ſupreme Princes may put it into a Forreigners power to compel them</hi> (to ceſſion) <hi>by a direct deprivation of their Right of Government, is a caſe which he thinks none will eaſily grant to be either</hi> Juſt <hi>or</hi> Secure <hi>for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth for which they were concern'd.</hi> I conceive that when K. <hi>John</hi> reſign'd his Kingdom, and receiv'd it again to hold of the Pope, as principal Lord, to whom he became a Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, He put it into the power of a Forreigner to compel him, not only by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, but by a direct deprivation of his Right of Government. And this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be Unjuſt, and Unſafe for the Commonwealth. King <hi>John</hi> then, even in his own opinion, did unjuſtly, and againſt the good of the Commonwealth, that is, had not Right to do what he did, and his Act was invalid from the beginning. I ſuppoſe therefore He will acknowledg on ſecond thoughts, that there are other ways to bound the actions of ſupreme Princes, beſides Compacts and Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and the <hi>Safety of the Commonwealth,</hi> are two of thoſe ways, in which other Princes were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to walk as well as K. <hi>John,</hi> and if they did not, their Actions are not to be drawn into example.</p>
                     <p>I will hope the Queſtion is reſolved to ſatisfaction. For I know no fairer, nor ſurer way to end a difference, than to put it to Judgment. And ſince 'tis judged on my ſide by an Authority from which there lyes no appeal, and by thoſe who one would expect ſhould be moſt partial on the other, Thoſe who contriv'd the Deed, and Him who urges it,<note place="margin">Of the Popes Temporal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> I ſhould think there is no more to be deſir'd. If any mans curioſity reach further, he may find wherewith to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it in thoſe who have already handled this Subject; particularly the learned <hi>Crakanthrop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to touch briefly what is more largely treated elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106994:167"/> the <hi>Charter</hi> contradicts and deſtroys it ſelf, reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one place, what it grants in another. There is in it an expreſs ſaving of the Rights given away, by this clauſe, <hi>Salvis nobis &amp; Haeredibus noſtris Juſtitiis, Libertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; Regalibus noſtris.</hi> Nothing can be more manifeſt, than that the Independency of the Crown belongs to the <hi>Regalia;</hi> and again, that ſubjection is oppoſite to Liberty. And yet the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> are expreſly reſerv'd, at the ſame time, when the Crown is made Dependent, and Subject. This is juſt, I give you a hundred pound, which hundred pound I keep to my ſelf. Which is an unvalid and ſelf-deſtructive Act, and paſſes nothing, and is in truth a piece of Non-ſence, not a Gift. Again, that the <hi>Regalia Imperii</hi> are <hi>Inalienabilia</hi> without conſent of the Subjects, is a point ſetled by a conſent ſo unanimous of all Nations, that there is no Maxim more known. 'Tis very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and more idle, to fill paper with Quotations, for a point better known than the Author to be quoted.</p>
                     <p>This too is a receiv'd Maxim, that <hi>Metus cadens in virum conſtantem</hi> nuls the Act extorted by fear, of which, beſides a hundred examples in all nations, ſome even of Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who upon that ground have voided their own Acts, the Pope, to whom this Grant was made, has left a very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inſtance in the caſe of this very King. The Barons a little after obtained the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> from him, confirmed by all the ſecurity they could deviſe. The Pope ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares all proceedings void, becauſe extorted by fear. But it is moſt evident that K. <hi>John</hi> had no greater cauſe of fear, when he paſt the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> than he had, when he ſigned the <hi>Charter</hi> to the Pope. <hi>Pandulph</hi> brought him to it, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating his imminent danger, the <hi>French</hi> with a vaſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ready to land, backt with the Eccleſiaſtical power of the Clergy, and Arms of the Laity, whereof many of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal were ſaid to have oblig'd themſelves by authentick <hi>Charters</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French.</hi> The King yielded, <hi>confuſus valde, &amp; mente nimis perturbatus, &amp; videns undi<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ſibi periculum immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> in the words of <hi>M. Paris.</hi> Could there be more fear from the Barons alone, than from the ſame Barons, and <hi>French,</hi> and Pope too? Or could his fear in one caſe make his Act void, and ſignify nothing in the other? So that there is this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106994:168"/> very good reaſon to believe, that the Pope himſelf, to whom the Kingdom was granted, judged the Grant nul, becauſe he declared an Act of the ſame King nul by a leſs fear, than that which extorted his Grant. This too was underſtood by thoſe who drew the Charter, and inſerted this other clauſe, <hi>Non vi inducti, nec Timore coacti, ſed nostra bona, ſpontaneaque voluntate.</hi> By which it is apparent that there was more than one clauſe contrary to Truth, and that more was requiſite to the validity of the Act, even in the judgment of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, than could be had. Which is that the Act was invalid, as wanting what themſelves thought neceſſary to make it valid.</p>
                     <p>By this, and much more alledged by divers, the Nullity of that Grant of K. <hi>John</hi> appears, I think, very undeniably; ſuppoſing in him all the Right, which can be ſuppoſed in any King of <hi>England.</hi> But by our Authors favour, what he takes for granted, that K. <hi>John</hi> had undoubted Kight to the Crown, at the paſſing of this act, is very far from undoubted. A Siſter of <hi>Arthur's</hi> was then living, and long after, in whom the Right of <hi>Arthur</hi> could not but be. When K. <hi>John</hi> by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at <hi>Mirabel</hi> got <hi>Arthur</hi> into his hands, he made uſe of the opportunity of his victory to ſeize likewiſe upon his Siſter <hi>Elianor,</hi> whom he brought into <hi>England,</hi> and confin'd to <hi>Briſtol</hi> Caſtle. There was another, and I think an elder Siſter, but what became of her I know not. In likelyhood ſhe died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe times. But this Lady ſurviv'd her Uncle. The Pope mentions her, among thoſe who had right to the Crown, to the Embaſſadors of <hi>Lewis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">M. Paris <hi>ad an.</hi> 1216.</note> who ſought to juſtify their Maſters title to <hi>England,</hi> and the French objected againſt her, what, if it have any force in their Law, has none in ours. For it is a plain caſe that the elder line takes place of the younger, in the inheritance of the Crown, and no act, or forfeiture of K. <hi>John</hi> could bar the right of the Children of his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were Heirs, not to <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>Richard,</hi> and by <hi>John</hi> wrongfully excluded. This Lady never married, but liv'd to a good Age,<note place="margin">M. Paris <hi>ad an.</hi> 1241. Y podig. Neuſtriae <hi>p.</hi> 59.</note> one example of many of the little comfort there is in unſupported greatneſs. She dy'd in the year 1241, and was buried among the <hi>Nuns</hi> of <hi>Amesbury,</hi> to whom by permiſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> III. She gave the Mannor of <hi>Molſham.</hi> Her <hi>Right</hi> was buried with her, but while ſhe lived, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106994:168"/> be ſaid K. <hi>John</hi> had no Competitor. This being ſo, all pretence from K. <hi>Johns</hi> Fact, is cut up by the roots, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo much to be ſaid for it, as that himſelf had <hi>right</hi> to what he gave away. And yet for my part I think, if he had had a Right as unqueſtionable as our Author ſuppoſes, it is equally unqueſtionable that his gift was no more valid than if he had had none.</p>
                     <p>Whether I have acquitted my ſelf of what I undertook, and ſhewn the three material points of our Authors diſcourſe, <hi>viz, Conſent of the Barons, undoubted Right,</hi> and <hi>unconfin'd power in</hi> K. <hi>John,</hi> are all miſtakes, I am not to be my own Judge. It is the readers right, and to him I leave it. To paſs farther, and examine what elſe is urged, ſeems needleſs. When the Root is dig'd up, the Branches may be let alone; and I am far from taking pleaſure in contradicting, eſpecially a man whoſe Learning and Candor I eſteem. Yet, becauſe peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to neglect what he ſays, may ſhew more unhandſom than to diſſent from it, I ſhall briefly deliver my opinion of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>In the next point, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Popes Title was the more confirm'd by his uninterrupted Practice,</hi> I think He is miſtaken too. 'Tis true, that <hi>Henry</hi> III. did at his Coronation take an Oath of Fealty to the Pope, the ſame which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taken before. And there was a very preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which oblig'd him ſo to do. <hi>Lewis</hi> Son to the King of <hi>France</hi> was in the Bowels of the Kingdom with a ſtrong Army, and many of the Nobility took his part. The King was a Child, unable to do any thing for himſelf, and forc'd to depend entirely on thoſe who would aſſiſt him. Among theſe the Pope was the moſt conſiderable, whoſe Legat was with him, and with unweari'd earneſtneſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for his Intereſt. It was not for him, in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to break with the Pope. For it was evidently to ruin himſelf. So that 'twas wiſely done of his Councel to provide for the greater danger firſt, and leave the reſt to time. It is true alſo that King <hi>John</hi> made uſe of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to annul his conceſſion to the Barons. But it does not therefore follow there was no Interruption. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> proteſted at very firſt, and in the name of the whole Kingdom; the Barons refus'd to ſubmit to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106994:169"/> Popes ſentence, and ſtood to their obtain'd Conceſſions notwithſtanding his Excommunications; the <hi>French</hi> reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his claim with great ardor; ſolemn oppoſition was made in the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> both by King and Kingdom, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. ſucceeding Kings poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd all marks of ſubjection, and were abetted by unanimous conſent of Parliament. A Practice ſo much oppoſed I think cannot be called uninterrupted. Oppoſition ſure is Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or at leaſt as good. For the the act of one part, can never confirm a practice. The Pope may do what he pleaſes, but unleſs the Kingdom do ſomething too, his Title will never be confirmed. It may be ſaid that the Tribute was paid by <hi>Henry</hi> III. ſuppoſe it were, what is this to the Kingdom? <hi>Henry</hi> III. could not be hindred from diſpoſing of his own, and paying what, and to whom he pleaſed. But his Act cannot be thought binding to the Kingdom, unleſs the Kingdom conſented; And the Kingdom was ſo far from conſenting that it poſitively diſſented. Wherefore the practice being urged as a Title to the Kingdom, it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain, that this Title was ſo far from being <hi>more confirm'd,</hi> that it was not confirm'd at all, nor could be, by any practice of the Popes, unleſs the Kingdom had concurred to it.</p>
                     <p>The next point that <hi>the Pope never ſolemnly deveſted himſelf,</hi> I conceive not to purpoſe. For if his Title were never good, 'tis no matter whether he ever diſclaimed it or no. And yet, if the Author of the <hi>Eulogium,</hi> ſaid to be in the <hi>Cotton</hi> Library, be of any credit, this too may be deny'd. For he expreſly ſays, that in a Parliament at <hi>London</hi> 1214, where the Clergy <hi>cum tota laicali ſecta</hi> were preſent, the obligation was, by the Popes command, wholy releaſt. For my own part I muſt confeſs, I know not how far this Author may be truſted, not finding any mention of ſo remarkable a paſſage any where elſe. But though his credit be obſcure, this is clear, that if K. <hi>Johns</hi> Act were invalid of it ſelf, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Act of the Popes to make it ſo. And I take it to be no leſs clear, that it was invalid, and that we may ſpare the labour of inquiring, whether the Pope ever gave away, what he truly never had.</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing urged is that <hi>the Pope admits of no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106994:169"/> which if it be true, the leſs reaſon have we to put our ſelves upon that trial. But I think it is not true. For the Canon Law allows <hi>Preſcription,</hi> and that againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as any other. Only by way of Priviledge more time is required to bear her Plea, than others. But I have already declared, I like not to enter into that diſpute. It depends on Law, a ſtudy which the Intereſts and Paſſions of men have embroyl'd with ſo many intricate perplexities, that 'tis little better than a labyrinth without a Clew. Nothing in my opinion is more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, nor perhaps more dangerous than to ſubmit the Rights of Princes to diſputes, where there will be alwayes ſomething to ſay, and not half of what is ſaid, underſtood, but by men of the Trade.</p>
                     <p>Beſides there is another Conſideration, which to my Judgment, abſolutely excludes this Topick. <hi>Preſcription</hi> is a Plea eſtabliſh't by the Civil, and Canon Laws, which appoint the caſes, the perſons, the times, and all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Who has a Suit depending in a Court, where ſentence is pronounc't according to thoſe Laws, may be concern'd to ſtudy the nature of it: but with us, where neither Law is in force, it ſeems wonderfully from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amuſe our ſelves with it. What have we to do, to examin whether our Poſſeſſion have all the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>Preſcription</hi> by thoſe Laws, which themſelves ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing? If they pronounce ſentence for us, we are not a jot the better, and if againſt us, not a jot the worſe. <hi>England</hi> is a Country Independent of Forreigners, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Laws and Cuſtoms of her own. What Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Popes think fit to eſtabliſh among their Subjects, concerns us no more, than what we do concerns them. By our Laws the Grant of K. <hi>John</hi> is void, and has been poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declared ſo by the higheſt Tribunal among us, and from which there lyes no appeal. After this to put our ſelves upon the trial of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> ſeems a kind of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to forreign Laws, a kind of confeſſing the point, and acknowledgment of a ſuperiour Power.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Law of <hi>Preſcription</hi> is, as other Laws, made for avoiding confuſion in the Commonwealth, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the properties of members belonging to it. That
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106994:170"/> Commonwealths themſelves are alwayes ſubject to the ſame Laws with their members, I cannot eaſily underſtand. The caſe of <hi>John a Nokes</hi> and <hi>John a Stiles,</hi> is different from the ſupreme Lord of <hi>John a Nokes</hi> and <hi>John a Stiles.</hi> It is true that generally Crowns are inherited by the ſame Rules with private Eſtates. But ſometimes it happens otherwiſe, and 'tis the Intereſt of the Commonwealth, that what is not allow'd in one caſe, ſhould be in another. The Crown of <hi>England</hi> has a priviledge above all Eſtates which hold of it. For it takes away all defects; and this, whatever be in other places, is Law with us. I know not how idle time can be ſpent more idly than in unridling what is ſubtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Sphinxes of Laws, with which we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, while we have Laws of our own, whoſe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we know, and to whoſe authority we muſt and ought ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, if Iſſue were joyn'd upon this point, I think there is no reaſon to doubt of the ſentence. The Conditions required to a valid <hi>Preſcription</hi> by thoſe Laws, are <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> continu'd all the time determined by Law; a <hi>Title</hi> probably preſumed; and a <hi>prudent Perſwaſion</hi> that the thing in queſtion belongs to the poſſeſſor, or at leaſt to no body elſe, which they call <hi>Bona Fides.</hi> Now that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> has been in the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of thoſe who have worn it, neither is, nor can be doubted out of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> That this <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> has laſted much longer, than any time required to <hi>Preſcription,</hi> is as plain as the former. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years is the longeſt time allow'd in any caſe, and bars the claim even of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>

Farther, that the <hi>Title</hi> of our Princes is ſomething more than probably preſum'd, and conſequently that their <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> has alwayes been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd with <hi>bona Fides,</hi> is as undeniable as all the reſt. So that I think our Author has reaſon to believe <hi>Preſcription</hi> a very ſufficient Plea againſt the Pope, though I am not of his mind, that 'tis our only one.</p>
                     <p>But this by the by, and to ſhew we need not fear fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this quarrel, at any weapon. Otherwiſe, to my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106994:170"/> apprehenſion, it is as rational to talk of the Laws of <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi> as of Emperours and Popes, with relation to <hi>England.</hi> Local Laws concern only thoſe who live where they are in force; betwixt Nation and Nation there is no other Law, but that of Nations and Nature. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, if we look better into it, <hi>Preſcription</hi> may it ſelf be a Law of Nations. For though it be generally taken in the notion of Civil and Canon Lawyers, and go attended with the train of conditions plac't about it by them, yet it may as properly ſignifie the ſame with <hi>immemorial Poſſeſſion.</hi> So I think our Law underſtands it, without any notice of <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>bona Fides,</hi> or any thing elſe but <hi>quiet Poſſeſſion.</hi> And ſo it may be this learned Gentleman himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, which if he did, it is undoubtedly, not only a ſufficient, but the beſt and ſtrongeſt Plea that can be. It is that whereon the firmneſs of moſt, perhaps all, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths in the world depends, and in which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Nations acknowledges an unqueſtionable force, and which, for that reaſon muſt needs be grounded on Nature. Becauſe Authors commonly take <hi>Preſcription</hi> in the other ſence, I thought it moſt convenient to go along with the cry, and ſpeak in their language. So taken, I refuſe it for a Judg, not that I fear it ſhould give ſentence againſt me, but becauſe I think it not qualifi'd to give ſentence, our caſe belonging not to the cogniſance of that Court. But taken in the other ſence, as I cannot refuſe to ſtand to that, on which the ſecurity of the world is eſtabliſh't, ſo it is plainly of my ſide. It being not more known that we are a Nation, than that we are independent of forreign ſubjection, and have time out of mind continued in the poſſeſſion of ſuch independency, and in the ſight, and with the acknowledgment of all the world about us.</p>
                     <p>I know not how my pen runs on beyond my deſign, and without neceſſity, for much I think might be ſpared. To make an end, ſince this <hi>Fact</hi> of K. <hi>John</hi> was evidently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away what he had no power to give, no not though his right to the Crown had been undoubted, which 'tis plain it was not; ſince this want of power in him was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the very Contrivers of the <hi>Charter,</hi> who were forc't to ſupply the Defects, of which they were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106994:171"/> by Clauſes of Form, but evidently againſt Truth; ſince the Caſe is already a judg'd Caſe, both at home and abroad; ſince the judgment given at home is peremptorily concluſive, and unappealable; and has beſides been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by a Poſſeſſion, which to queſtion is to ſubvert the foundations of Government, and render all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths unſecure and tottering; I think no man of ſenſe can be mov'd by any thing, which can be ſaid on the Popes behalf in this point. But if ſo much ſcruple, and ſo little reaſon may be ſuſpected in our Nation, of all men in it the ſuſpicion ſhould not fall on thoſe of our Communion. We have given very good evidence of our ſence in this point, by publickly declaring it. For they were of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion who made the Act of Parliament, mention'd before, and ſolemnly reſolv'd this <hi>Fact</hi> in particular to be void and null. And they were of our Communion, who in another occaſion, declared the Independency of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Crown, and its freedom from all earthly ſubjection, and this with relation particularly to the Pope. If any one be found ſcrupulous enough, and mad enough, againſt all reaſon, and the judgment of his Anceſtors of his own Communion, to refuſe to give you all imaginable ſecurity in this point, I conſent with all my heart you treat him as a man degenerated from the loyalty of his Anceſtors, and no company for good Subjects.</p>
                     <p>It is now time to make a ſtep into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which though the novelty of ſtrange places be uſually full of wonder, yet I do not think to find any thing more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than this Bull of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> which you mention. That all Iſlands, which have receiv'd Chriſtianity, ſhould <hi>eo ipſo</hi> belong to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a thing in which often conſideration, as it happens in other caſes, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes nothing of the ſurprize. The more I conſider, the more I wonder, and as wondring people do, gaze, and ſtare, and hardly know what to ſay. I have a great mind bluntly to deny the thing; as I would an incredible ſtory related without proof. Nothing that ever I heard, not the inchantment of <hi>O Brazile</hi> ſounds more incredibly. But <hi>M. Paris</hi> and the reſt, who record it, have never been taxed of feigning, and <hi>Baronius</hi> ſays he found it in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican.</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106994:171"/>
'Tis not for me to oppoſe my perſwaſion to their credit, though all their credit, cannot hinder it from ſounding ſtill incredibly. There are many Iſlands nearer <hi>Rome, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Candia, Sicily, Sardignia</hi> and the reſt. If the Pope have a claim, as I think he has, to ſome of theſe, ſurely it is not purely becauſe they are Iſlands. For to ſome I do not know that he ever pretended. The Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> has many very conſiderable, <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cuba,</hi> and our <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to ſay nothing of the reſt, and nearer at hand the <hi>Canaries</hi> as little as they are, are yet worth having. It is as incredible a thing, as any can be, that <hi>Ireland</hi> alone ſhould be claimed by a pretence common to innumerable others, there being no continent which has not many, and no claim made to any of the reſt. <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Britain,</hi> is an Iſland too: How came it to ſcape, and all this buſtle made with King <hi>John,</hi> to gain a litigious, and unmaintainable pretence, to what was clearly the Popes before? Again, why has this pretence never been ſet a foot before, nor ſince, in no caſe, by no body? Were it not for this Bull, it could not be known, there ever was ſuch a conceit in the world, and notwithſtanding the Bull, it never entred, for ought I can learn,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. E B.

                     <p>But whence ſhould this ſubjection of Iſlands come? From their receiving Chriſtianity? If this were ſo, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve no difference betwixt Iſlands, and Continents, that Chriſtianity ſhould not work the ſame effects in both. For certainly what Chriſtianity does, it does every where. But that Chriſtianity has no ſuch effect, that <hi>non eripit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia qui regna dat coeleſtia,</hi> is known and confeſt, and has been diſcourſt enough formerly. If ſuch a thing were once admitted of Iſlands, ſuch another Bull might turn the whole world into one great Iſland, and all were the Popes without more ado. Or may the famous <hi>Donation</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantin,</hi> becauſe it has the word <hi>Iſlands,</hi> ground this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? The word indeed is uſed once, but nothing more is ſaid of them, than that ſome revenues are granted out of ſome of them, as well as other places, towards main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining lights at <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides the <hi>Donation</hi> it ſelf ſignifies nothing, and if it did cannot be ſtretcht to <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106994:172"/> never was in the power of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> to diſpoſe of. A claim to <hi>all</hi> Chriſtian Iſlands can never have its origin from <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> who was not poſſeſs't of, nor ſo much as acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the hundredth part of them, and yet before the end of the world we hope <hi>The ſun of Justice</hi> will ſhine upon them all.</p>
                     <p>Truly I am utterly at a loſs, and which way ſoever I turn me, can make nothing of it, unleſs the <hi>Right,</hi> of which this Bull ſpeaks, be underſtood of a <hi>Spiritual Right.</hi> Such an one the Pope may claim, and that in vertue of their receiving Chriſtianity, and if he ſpoke only of Iſlands, I would think the reaſon was becauſe, the queſtion being only of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was not to his purpoſe to ſpeak of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents.</hi> So that I would underſtand the Bull in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: You deſire my favour and counſel, in your deſign upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> which you mean to undertake for the good of the Country in general, and the Church in particular; Iſlands belonging to my care, as well as the reſt of the world: I am glad all the good be done there which can, and ſo approve your deſign, and wiſh you to go on. I know not whether I ſhall not paſs for too bold an interpreter, but I will hope at leaſt, that this is the ſence; if it be not, I ſhould be beholding to him who could inſtruct me what is.</p>
                     <p>But be it what it will, I am ſure a ſingle line, inſerted in an old writing, no body knows why, or upon what ground, and never inſiſted on before, nor ſince, no not by the moſt partial Abetters of the Popes Prerogatives, is a ſorry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by which to claim a Kingdom. The Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have held that Country above 500 years, and all that time been acknowledged abſolute Lords of it, by all the world, and Popes as well as the reſt. No Homage, no Tribute, no Inveſtiture, no ſign of ſubjection to the Pope, has all this while appeared, ſave in the reſignation of King <hi>John,</hi> nothing perform'd on our ſide, nothing ſo much as demanded on the other. The world would run into a fine confuſion, if ſuch a Title ſhould be queſtioned, becauſe ſome words are found in a writing 500 years ago, which no body can underſtand. Popes have not been careleſs in their Rights: <hi>England</hi> in ſome of the intermediate times
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106994:172"/> has been even ſcrupulouſly affected to them, and a great deal more ready to add to, than detract from their due. It is not poſſible but, if this Title had been any thing worth we ſhould have heard of it at ſome time or other, elſewhere than in the Bull. At leaſt in the tranſactions with King <hi>John,</hi> it muſt of neceſſity have appeared. That King was not in terms to refuſe any thing the Pope ſhould demand. Had he known of any right to <hi>Ireland,</hi> it had been but ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo: for it was upon the matter, <hi>Ask and Have,</hi> any pretence in that conjuncture would have ſerved turn. And this Bull was not then ſo old, that it could be worn out of memory. But it is plain that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are both on the ſame terms in the grant of King <hi>John,</hi> and no right pretended to either but in vertue of that grant. Neither indeed can ſuch a pretence conſiſt with the words of it. Inſtead of <hi>Offerimus &amp; libere concedimus,</hi> it muſt have been ſaid, we reſtore, or acknowledge, or ſomething equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by which there might have appear'd not creation of a new Right, but recognition of an old. For that cannot be granted, which is the Grantee's before the Grant, nor does a ſupream Lord receive a Fee from a Vaſſal by way of gift; but obliges the Vaſſal to acknowledge by Homage, and cuſtomary duties that it is ſo; or if diſuſe have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his duties, and weakned his Title, to reſtore things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to their old condition. This, inſtead of granting, King <hi>John</hi> ſhould, and the Pope would have made him, have done, had there been any knowledge of a claim to <hi>Ireland</hi> independently of this Grant. So that whatever Pope <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> mean't, it is evident his Succeſſors never underſtood his meaning gave them any right to that Iſland. Nothing is more fooliſh, than to catch at words, and interpret the meaning by the ſound, when we have Actions, immemori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al practice, and cuſtom to guide us ſecurely, and aſſure us the meaning, whatever it be cannot be contrary to theſe. Allow that method once, and you leave no ſtability, even in what the good of mankind requires ſhould be moſt ſtable, the ſettlement of Commonwealths.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, if our Kings Title to <hi>Ireland</hi> be not good, there is no good Title in the world. At leaſt I know none eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't on a ſurer foundation. And were it the queſtion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106994:173"/> believe I could make it out. But we are not now enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what Title our Kings have, but whether the Pope have any. For which reaſon I forbear to meddle with the Book you mention, which ſeeks to overthrow the Title of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not to eſtabliſh that of the Pope. Only in ſhort I muſt acknowledg I never read any thing with more grief, nor ſo much ſhame. The beſt is, the Curs't Cow has won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous ſhort horns. As ill as He means, in my opinion, he does more good than harm. For Truth is well proved, when 'tis perceived it cannot be diſproved but weakly. And nothing is weaker than his diſcourſe. What is moſt material, is directly contrary to Hiſtory; but his chief buſineſs is to bring, as you ſay, hard names to prove, what is not a jot to purpoſe when 'tis proved. He caſts away the greateſt part of his pains upon the Punctilios required to <hi>Preſcription</hi> by the Civil and Canon Laws, in Suits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Subject and Subject, and never conſiders that thoſe Punctilios, and thoſe Laws have nothing to do with the caſe, and that the Rights of Princes are eſtabliſh't upon a higher, and more ſteady Baſis, than local and mutable conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But I have diſcours'd of this point before, and mean not to trouble you with repetitions, and that in a Queſtion which concerns me not. No better anſwer can, nor other need,<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Remonſt p. 739. &amp; 742.</note> be given to this Book, than what was given in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where <hi>an.</hi> 1648. the <hi>ſupreme Council</hi> of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Catholicks, caus'd it to be burn't at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> by the common Hangman, and the National Congregation too of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy (I mean <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) at <hi>Dublin, an.</hi> 1666. condemn'd it to the ſame fate. And for the reſt, whoever doubts of his Majeſties <hi>right,</hi> to all and every part of his Dominions, is a Traitor without more ado, and cannot complain if he be us'd like one, nor any body for him.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer I conceive may ſerve for <hi>Scotland</hi> too, with which I ſhall make ſhort work, believing your Jealouſies in that particular are not very preſſing. The only ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block that I know in this matter, is the letter you cite of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. to. <hi>Edward</hi> I. in which,<note place="margin">Mat. Weſtm. <hi>ad an.</hi> 1301.</note> with a phraſe as unintelligible, as that of <hi>Adrians</hi> Bull, it is ſaid, <hi>qualiter ab antiquis temporibus Regnum Scotiae pleno jure pertinuit, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106994:173"/> pertinere dignoſcitur ad Eccleſiam ſupradictam,</hi> meaning the <hi>Roman.</hi> And again, <hi>ex quibus nulli in dubium veniat Regnum Scotiae praelibatum ad praefatam Rom. Eccleſiam pertinere.</hi> While I read this Letter, and the Kings anſwer, I was inclin'd to believe, the meaning of this was, that the Pope as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of Chriſtendom, had right to interpoſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent differences in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as other places. I obſerved that he alledges <hi>Debitum Paſtoralis Officii</hi> for the reaſon why he meddles, and reſpect to his ſeat and Perſon, for the motive why the King ſhould yield to his requeſt. Again, the <hi>Ex quibus</hi> whence he concludes this ſubjection, are becauſe <hi>Scotland uſed not to admit a Legat, not particularly directed to that Kingdom;</hi> That <hi>the Arch Biſhop of York could not obtain ſentence at</hi> Rome <hi>in favour of the Primacy claimed by him over the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Churches;</hi> and that <hi>the Kingdom was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Relicks of</hi> Saint <hi>Andrew.</hi> Theſe have ſo little to do with Civil ſubjection to <hi>Rome</hi> (and what he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides has a great deal leſs) that I could not imagine a Pope, from ſuch Premiſes, could draw ſuch a concluſion. Beſides that the King in his anſwer does not take the leaſt notice of ſuch a ſence. But coming to read the anſwer of the Nobility, to whom the King purpoſely left that point, I percieve they underſtood the words as they ſounded. I ſhall therefore give their anſwer, and make an end. <hi>Your letters being read,</hi> ſay they, <hi>tam ſenſibus noſtris admiranda, quam hactenus inaudita in jis audivimus contineri. Scimus enim — nec ullis temporibus ipſum regnum in temporalibus pertinuit, vel pertinet quovis jure ad Eccleſiam veſtram ſupradictam,</hi> and again, <hi>nec etiam Reges Scoterum &amp; Regnum aliis quam Regibus Angliae ſubfuerunt, vel ſubjici conſueverunt.</hi> Purſuant hereunto, They would not conſent the King ſhould ſend Proctors, as the Pope deſir'd, to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make out his Title there; nay they declare, They would not permit the King to do it, although he would, it being too great a prejudice to his known Rights to ſubmit them to Trial. If this do not ſatisfy I know not what will. At leaſt it did ſatisfy the Pope, who in <hi>Pol. Virgils</hi> words, <hi>ſtatim refrixit,</hi>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106994:174"/> Parliament, or at leaſt of a great Council of the Nobility, which in thoſe days was equivalent.</p>
                     <p>I Am come to the end of your Letter, and I think of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too. Unleſs you do ſomething on your ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides asking queſtions, painful to reſolve, and fruitleſs when they are reſolved, you have my laſt, (it may be your full wiſh, my firſt too;) For I cannot anſwer it to reaſon, to continue ſowing in barren ground, and believe, while ſo much trouble is coming on us all, your ſelf would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel me not to run into more, that of breaking my brains to no purpoſe. There has been already ſaid, what, I hoped, might have wrought more favourable inclinations towards us. Since the Phyſick works not, whether by your indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or its own inefficacy, 'tis peradventure to play the fooliſh, as well as unskilful, Emperick, to go on ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring. But yet ſince Loſers have leave to talk, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to make uſe of that liberty, it may be the only one which I ſhall long enjoy.</p>
                     <p>As much reaſon as I have to grieve, yet truly I cannot but wonder as much at your proceedings. Can it poſſibly be your intereſt to keep a party alwayes in fear of the Law, and by that fear prompted to wiſh a change in it? I miſtake if it be not the Intereſt of every Commonwealth, that all the members be heartily concern'd for the maintenance of Law, becauſe it is the main ſecurity of Liberty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and all worldly goods. But in our caſe the Law, inſtead of ſecuring, threatens our Liberties, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Lives, nor can we be concerned in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, without being unconcerned in the preſervation of our ſelves. For my life I cannot imagin by what Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you are guided, to lay upon never ſo inconſiderable a party, a neceſſity ſo ſtrong as that of ſelf-preſervation, to wiſh an alteration of Law. The ſword of Juſtice ſhould be the Protection, and comfort of Good men, and a terrour only to the bad: and certainly you do not think us all ſuch. I believe our greateſt fault is that you apprehend us deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of innovation. But pray can you with reaſon blame us, if we deſire to live leſs uneaſily? I am very certain, there are none in the Nation, more heartily affected to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106994:174"/> the liberty and all advantages of it, than we are by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſhould more appear by all juſtifiable actions, if you would let us live with any comfort in it.</p>
                     <p>Again, can it be for your intereſt, to force part of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> alwayes to depend on Forreigners, by their interpoſition to ſeek relief from their preſſures, and in return be affected to them, and inclined by way of gratitude to promote their deſires? Can it be your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to oblige us to ſend our Children beyond Sea, to be bred up to forreign cuſtoms and inclinations, and ſuck in principles which you diſlike? To have ſo much money as they, and ſo many religious of both ſexes require, carried out of the Land, and ſpent in other Countreys? To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Seminaries and increaſe their number? For if we cannot maintain our Children at home, we muſt ſend them abroad, and they are not now to begin to live on Alms, if we cannot ſend money with them, and that more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than we perhaps ſhould allow them.</p>
                     <p>But to let theſe things alone, do you think it for your credit not to do as you would be done by? to gain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of perſecuters, perſecuters of a Religion profeſt by moſt of your neighbours, and of a Church from which you derive your ſelves? For I hope you do not think to avoid that imputation, becauſe what you do, you do by Law. The primitive Chriſtians ſuffered all by Law, and by Authority, and yet are thought perſecuted, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs even by your ſelves. Nor were Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without Law, and Law, not made by her for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, but in force before ſhe came to the Crown. You have reaſon to reproach her times; but then ſure you have the ſame reaſon not to bring the ſame reproach on your own: for burning is not much worſe, than hanging and quartering. If you are perſwaded Perſecution, or if that word diſlike you, Puniſhment for Religion adviſable; at leaſt conſider that our caſe is different from that of other diſſenters. We changed not from the Law, but the Law from us. We are to the Reformation as Judaiſm and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm to the Goſpel, before it. The Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when Authority came to be on their ſide, never made uſe of it to work upon the conſcience of thoſe, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106994:175"/> in Religion were more antient than their own. They imploy'd inſtruction, and example, and added the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement of worldly preferment, diſpoſing of places of Truſt and Profit only to Chriſtians. But they came not to force. Me thinks you ſhould not condemn the practice of the Primitive times, and uſe us worſe than they thought fit, and I think lawful, to uſe <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You might too, in my opinion, conſider whether it be for your advantage, to let fall the plea you have ſo long, and ſo univerſally maintained, that you puniſh, not for Religion, but Treaſon. When we ask where this Treaſon lies, the anſwer alwaies is, that it lies in our perſwaſions concerning the Pope in whom we believe a power inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the ſafety of Princes or fidelity of Subjects. This the perſon of Honour againſt S. C. makes the only cauſe of <hi>jealouſy, or ſuſpition of our Fidelity, which may prove dangerous to the Kingdom, and againſt which the laws are provided:</hi> This the <hi>Execution of Juſtice;</hi> This every body aſſigns for the Treaſon laid to our charge. When this is taken away, there remains nothing that I know, but Religion for which we are to be puniſh't. I hope I have declared my mind ſufficiently in this point, and cleared my ſelf, and thoſe of the ſame judgment with me, from all guilt of this Treaſon. If you will notwithſtanding puniſh us, you may if you pleaſe, but I am ſure you cannot ſay you puniſh us for Treaſon. The laws being as they are, it may ſhew very ſtrange to pretend favour from them: but yet confiding in the authority of this Honourable Perſon, who ſays they were provided againſt Opinions, which I have diſclaimed, and conſidering the laws themſelves mention withdrawing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their natural Obedience (23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 3. <hi>Jac.</hi>) as the ground of their ſeverity, I hope it will not misbecome me, to wiſh you would be more guided by their intention, than Letter. The intention of laws I think is acknowledged their beſt Interpreter; were the judgment of this Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of value with you, I ſhould not doubt you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome equity in my wiſhes; for I am ſure I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of that intention.</p>
                     <p>But I am not ſo vain as to appeal to any thing but mercy. As nothing more becomes me to ask, ſo nothing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106994:175"/> you to ſhew, though truly I think it not more for your Honour than intereſt in this caſe. Certainly you would not have theſe Principles gain ſtrength, againſt which you teſtify ſo much averſion. Why then do you do all you can, to make them paſs for Principles of Religion? For while you treat equally thoſe who diſclaim, and thoſe who hold them, and put no difference betwixt them and points of Faith, you bid fairly to perſwade people that there is none, and that they ought to ſuffer as much for the one as the other. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks your own experience ſhould inſtruct you, that 'tis no eaſy thing, to pluck up any perſwaſions, which are thought to ſpring from the root of Religion, let them be never ſo falſe or wicked, and that it concerns you ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to let more than are, be thought incorporated with it. If this import you not, can it at leaſt be for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that thoſe who would comply with you, ſhould be in a much worſe condition, than thoſe who will not, and this purely for their compliance? The equality, which you ſhew, hinders not the caſes, of the one and the other, from being very unequal, and the disadvantage of the inequality lies on that ſide which is inclin'd to you. Theſe are in the worſt caſe of any of our communion. For the reſt ſuffer only from you, theſe from you and us too.</p>
                     <p>Pray reflect a little how the world has gone, and goes with thoſe who gratify you in this matter. What was the event of that unwearied conſtancy which the learned <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrington</hi> ſhew'd in it? He loſt his good name, his Friends, all comforts of life, all ſweetneſs of ſociety with thoſe of his own communion, and had not ſo much as Liberty from you, but liv'd and dy'd a Priſoner. <hi>Walſh</hi> ſucceeds him, in learning, in fidelity, in conſtancy, and in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood fortune. He has appear'd ſo far in this buſineſs, that I believe he thinks it not ſafe to appear in any part of the world where the Pope bears ſway: and yet for ought I know has as little ſecurity at home as abroad. His Liberty and Life are at the mercy of every informer, it not being in the power of any Judge, before whom he ſhall be brought, to ſave him from the puniſhment appointed for Treaſon. <hi>Harold</hi> is another who has appeared in this cauſe with the ſame ſucceſs. He lives confin'd in a convent of his own
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106994:176"/> order, in or near <hi>Bruxels,</hi> becauſe he refuſes to retract the <hi>Iriſh</hi> remonſtrance, without an expreſs ſaving of fidelity to his King. This by the Congregation <hi>de Propaganda</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was judged a captious exception, and the man is by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternuncio of <hi>Bruxels</hi> confin'd againſt his will, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the permiſſion of his own Superiors to retire elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. <hi>Coppinger</hi> and the reſt of the regular Remonſtrants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſay nothing of other, and thoſe many and grievous vexations, are either actually baniſht by the late Proclamation againſt Biſhops and Regulars, or live in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream danger, and fear of being diſcovered and expos'd to the law by thoſe, who hate them for their conſtancy to the Remonſtrance. And this is the ſate of all who gratify you with thoſe teſtimonies of Loyalty which you are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually urging.</p>
                     <p>Time was when you objected againſt me, that we had an unintelligible way of Government among us. Permit me to ſay I can as little underſtand yours. He was a wiſe Prince who cauſed the Oath of Allegiance to be made, with deſign to diſtinguiſh the dangerous Principles, which he thought concurred to the Powder Treaſon, from others which were innocent. Who can underſtand, why thoſe, who by that Diſtinction are found on the right ſide, ſhould always be in worſe condition than thoſe who are on the wrong? Did K. <hi>James</hi> or the Parliament, when they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht a Diſtinction by Law, mean to find out the Innocent, by their diſtinction, that they might be the worſe for their Innocence? To impute Danger and Treaſon to one part, and puniſh both, and the not-dangerous, and not-Traitors more? For ſo they are though not by you. This is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of your Diſtinction, though ſure it was never the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The Act ſeems made to diſtinguiſh the Treaſon, for which you ſay we ſuffer, from the Religion, for which you ſay we do not. And when all is done, they are not ſo much as exempt from the puniſhment of Traitors, who by this Act are exempted from the guilt of Treaſon. <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was no Traitor, his actions and writings clear him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently. <hi>Walſh</hi> is no Traitor, on the contrary he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proofs of Fidelity which few could, and fewer perhaps would. And yet the Law looks on him, and may to day
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106994:176"/> or to morrow paſs on him as a Traitor. Truly it is not intelligible, at leaſt to my dulneſs, how it ſhould be for your intereſt, that things ſhould be carried in this manner. This I know, that while they are ſo, few will comply with you, I mean where with a ſafe conſcience they may. For Hopes and Fears are the main motives, which carry human nature, and 'tis not to be expected people ſhould gratifie you, when they have nothing to hope, and more to fear, than when they do not. For my own part I think you very unreaſonable to quarrel at me for being conceal'd, and ſingle. At leaſt I am not ſo unreaſonable as to court any man, by joyning with me, to run the fate of <hi>Walſh</hi> and <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and will avoid it my ſelf as long as I can. I reliſh not their uncomfortable condition, finding it uncomfortable enough to live in perpetual fear of the Laws: But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they ſhall not take hold on me for Treaſon; For I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain diſclaim thoſe poſitions which you ſay are Treaſonable. More I could and would ſay to you, if none ſaw my letters but your ſelf. But thus much I profeſs to all the world; and beſides, that I am</p>

                  <head>This following Quotation out of Dr. <hi>H.

But the Book (of the ſaid Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi>) which has it, came not to hand ſoon enough to inſert it there. And yet being ſo directly and fully to purpoſe, I would not omit giving it here.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Believe and do ſuppoſe there are ſome, <hi>[Popiſh Prieſts]</hi> who in the ſimplicity of their hearts, and out of meer Conſcience of Religion, do labour the propagation of it, whilſt others more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are guilty of Seditious and Treaſonable Practices. It is my wiſh there could be a diſtinction made between the one and the other, that the puniſhment (which the Law adjudges all Priests to, that are found within the Land) might only fall upon them, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed guilty of ſuch practices, which being ſo frequently found in their predeceſſors (and the State being not able to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, who are all Miſſionaries of <hi>Rome</hi>) cauſed thoſe Laws to be made for the ſecurity of Prince and State. And if they that come into the Land, without any Treaſonable intent, do ſuffer for it, they muſt thank their fellows (as the above-mentioned Seculars do the Jeſuits) whoſe reſtleſs attempts forced the State to forbid them all entrance into the Land under pain of Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; it is not Religion, nor the Function, nor any Miniſterial Act belonging to it, that is puniſhed in <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, but Treaſon and Seditious practices, to which <hi>Religion, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Miniſtery of Reconciliation,</hi> and all that is reputed Holy, are made to ſerve; and all this to advance and ſecure the Papal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.

                     <p>I Have got a new Flea in my Ear, which you muſt needs pull out. It is like enough my importunity may not be over-welcom, and you may think perhaps I grate on our Friendſhip, by preſſing you againſt your humour: But truly, I have no mind to remain in the dark till you be in the humour of Writing. I may tarry long enough, for ought I ſee, if I ſtay till that day comes. In ſhort, I think my curioſity more reaſonable than your humour; and for our Friendſhip I have given enough to it, and more than I can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to my reaſon, by forbearing you thus long; not but that your laſt complaints appeared to me as Juſt as Pathetical, and I truly wiſh I were able to contribute more to your eaſe than a fruitleſs compaſſion. But what? becauſe the World goes not as we would have it, muſt we therefore whine away our lives, and mourn our ſelves out of what we may have, becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have all we would? Alas! we are but Paſſengers in the Ship of the World. Whatever our deſires, whatever our concerns are, we muſt be carried as Winds and Tides drive the great Veſſel. Conſider what a fine kind of madneſs 'twould be, to grow ſullen, and neglect our ſelves, and fall out with our fellow Paſſengers, becauſe the Winds do not blow as we would have them. You and I have nothing to do with the Helm, and 'tis well we have not, for with our unskilfulneſs we ſhould quickly have more to complain of than croſs Winds. But we know there is a Pilot whom the Seas and Winds obey, and who having the appointing of his Subſtitutes, we are ſure has choſen the fitteſt. However we know he watches over them himſelf, and will certainly bring the Veſſel ſafe into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at laſt. The care of our paſſage is a buſineſs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, and with him we may ſecurely truſt it. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, I cannot ſee it is other than plain folly to repine our ſelves at matters which belong not to us, and are beſides in ſafe hands, into a neglect of thoſe which do. Our only buſineſs is to know as much as we can of our duty, and do as much as we know; and this you ſhall permit me to purſue. If you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106994:179"/> refuſe to go along with me, I muſt tell you plainly I ſhall have more reaſon to complain of your reſty humour, than you of any thing beſides.</p>
                     <p>Lighting by chance on <hi>Aitzema</hi>'s <hi>Reſolutions in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> I obſerved an Addreſs, from the Deputys of the Synods to the States General, which ſhockt me ſtrangely. The firſt Article of the means propoſed by them for hindring the Popes Hierarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> runs thus, <hi>That all of the Popiſh Clergy, Jeſuits, Prieſts, Fryars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be kept out of the Land, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Subjects of any ſecular Princes or Magiſtrates, but only of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>according to their own Tenets,</hi> &amp;c. Now I wonder not to ſee the Deputys of Synods willing to be rid of their Clergys company. Every body knows there is no great kindneſs betwixt them: but that they ſhould deny them to be ſubjects of Secular Princes, and bring even themſelves for Vouchers, is a thing I know not what to make of.</p>
                     <p>Pray <hi>Friend,</hi> do theſe men ſay true? If they do, the Pope is much a greater man than I took him for. 'Tis not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Liberality of <hi>Pepin,</hi> or <hi>Mathildir</hi> which confines his Soveraignty: for 'tis plainly extended as far as his communion, and that not only upon the ſcore of that Supremacy, which ſhares ſtakes with Princes, and leaving Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals to them contents it ſelf with Spirituals; but with a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority which admits no Co-partnerſhip, and ſweeps all for himſelf. Methinks it is a pretty trick this of the Pope to get his Subjects maintained at other folks charges, and ſet up a Principality of his own in the Dominions of other Princes. But yet I wonder how he could contrive it: for ſhould any man but the Pope come to any Prince, and ſay, I beſeech you, Sir, let ſo many of your Subjects leave acknowledging you, and turn Subject to me; he had need of great power in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to hope to prevail. What wiſe buſtles have ſometimes been made in the World, and peradventure ſtill continue in ſome places! Princes think they do great matters when they ſuffer not the Pope to diſpoſe of Benefices in their Territories to others than their own Subjects; when all the while they have it ſeems no Subjects to whom they can be diſpoſed, unleſs they would have them diſpoſed to the Laity, which every body knows cannot be: yet much ado they keep to have thoſe only preferred, who are born in places Subject to them; as if it were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106994:179"/> any matter where they were born, if when they come to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they are no longer Subject to any but the Pope; and all the diſpute be, whether he ſhall promote a Subject of this or that Nation, but ſtill equally his own Subject. By this account a Benefice is a ſtrange thing; for it diſſolves the Tye betwixt Prince and Subject. And I ſhould think there is no worſe nor more ruinous Simony in the World, than to purchaſe one at the price of Allegiance.</p>
                     <p>I tell you truly, <hi>Friend,</hi> all this looks to me with a very odd face, and would almoſt tempt me to ſuſpect animoſity had tranſported the <hi>Holland</hi> Deputys to ſay more than perhaps they believed. Yet I thought it incredible, that perſons choſen and Commiſſionated to repreſent their Churches, ſhould come with a lie in their mouth to an Aſſembly of the <hi>States General.</hi> Beſides, the Aſſembly ſitting long, the Churches made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Addreſs by new Deputys; and They again inſiſted on the ſame Article, and for the ſame reaſon. I could not believe this perſeverance in a change of perſons could be without ground. Nevertheleſs, as I love to hear both ſides, I was deſirous to know what your men ſay to the matter.</p>
                     <p>I had none but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> at hand, with whom, to tell you the truth, I cared not to meddle; I have dealt with him, you know, formerly, and found not my account, and ſhould have been glad of another Chapman. But I was over-ſtockt with Curioſity, a fretting Ware, and which will not ſtay for a good Market. As much as my mind miſgave me, in defect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ventur'd on him, and read his 28 and 29 Chapters of his firſt Book <hi>de Clericis,</hi> where he treats of this matter; and 'tis juſt as I feared; for I know not how it happened, but I have alwaies mighty ill luck with <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> for any ſatisfaction I have got, I might e'en as well have thrown Croſs or Pile for the matter. To my thinking, he talks a good while on both ſides, and ſo as to reſerve the liberty of anſwering <hi>Subjects,</hi> or <hi>not Subjects,</hi> as happens to be moſt convenient when the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is askt. On the one ſide he tells us that the Clergy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Clerical capacity, are alſo Citizens and parts of the Politick Common-wealth, and in that reſpect obliged to keep the Civil Laws, conſiſtent with the holy Canons and duty of a Clerical life; becauſe otherwiſe much trouble and confuſion would happen in the Common-wealth. On the other ſide,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106994:180"/> that the obligation, which the Clergy have to obſerve the Civil Laws, is directive only, not co-active, and that only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of an Eccleſiaſtical Law. For ſhould an Eccleſiaſtical Law diſpoſe otherwiſe even of the temporal things ordered by the Civil Law, the Clergy are to ſtick to the Eccleſiaſtical, and not obſerve the Civil ſo much as directively. Again, that they cannot be judged by the Civil Magiſtrate, if they do not keep the Civil Law; and that their Goods, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Secular are not liable to the Tributes of Secular Princes.</p>
                     <p>To my apprehenſion now, the Clergy, according to one half of this Doctrine, are very good Subjects; according to the other, none at all. If they be parts of the Common-wealth, they muſt of neceſſity be Subjects, unleſs they be Princes; For a Common-wealth holds none but Prince and Subjects. If they be oblig'd to the obſervation of the Civil Laws, they are Subjects again, that obligation being the very thing we call ſubjection. But if their Actions, when they break the Laws, are not liable to the cognizance of the Civil Magiſtrate, nor their Goods in their ſhare in the common burthens; if they obey the Laws only out of good nature, and to do as others do, and no longer than till they have order to the contrary, I ſhould think they are not Subjects, unleſs in reſpect of him whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they are to obey. For there can be no Subjects without a Prince, nor Prince without Power, nor Power without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on which it may be exerciſed. If the Secular Prince can exerciſe no power over their perſons, nor what they have, nor what they do; there remains nothing, that I ſee, on which his Power can work; and conſequently neither Power, nor Prince, nor Subject. Wherefore to my apprehenſion all this is Handy Dandy: the Clergy are Subjects, or not Subjects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hand you chuſe, or <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will open.</p>
                     <p>I could be content to underſtand by the way, if I might hope to underſtand any thing of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> what meaning there is in his diſtinction betwixt Directive and Co-active obligation. What Directive means, and what Co-active, I think, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. He who ſhews me a way I know not, is ſaid to Direct; and who draws me along in it, whether I will or no, to Force me. So Laws are properly called Directive, becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what we are to do; and Co-active, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us by fear of puniſhment to follow their direction. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106994:180"/> to this, it may be ſaid with ſence, whether with Truth or no is another Queſtion, That the Clergy are directed by the Laws to what is fit for them to do, but not obliged to do it. But it paſſes my capacity how Obligation ſhould be divided into Directive and Co-active, or Co-active, and not Co-active, when all obligation to my thinking is Co-active. For ſince he who is obliged to any thing, is not at liberty to do, or leave it undone, but conſtrained to do it in force of the obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, methinks obligation imports Co-action in its Notion; and that to ſay, there can be an obligation which is not Co-active, is to ſay there can be an obligation which is not an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. I fancy <hi>Bellarmin</hi> took his hint from Princes, who being free from the Co-action of their Laws, yet obſerve their Direction becauſe they will, and ſee it fit. But then for this very reaſon, becauſe they are not ſubject to their co-action, we ſay Princes are abſolutely not obliged by their Laws; and if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had a mind to make the caſe equal betwixt them and the Clergy, he ſhould put no obligation in the Clergy, as the Language of the World puts none in Princes. Yet to ſay the truth, I conceive by his not co-active obligation, he intended not to exempt the Clergy from conſtraint and puniſhment, ſo the Secular Magiſtrate have nothing to do with it; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he have or no, I enquire not now. Whoever has to do with it, if the thing be to be done, if the Clergy be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Eccleſiaſtical Court only if you will, co-action ſtill is inſeparable from obligation, and not co-active obligation pure riddle.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſince the reaſon he gives of his Directive obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergy, is to avoid confuſion in the Common-wealth, I would gladly know how much leſs confuſion there would be, if they broke the Laws, not by a reſtineſs of their own, but by command from another. Both ways the Laws would be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo the thing be done, it matters not much which way. If there be any difference, I ſhould think diſobedience from private Capricios leſs inconvenient than from publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Capricios are ſeldom either univerſal or laſting. Thoſe who remain'd ſober, would help to reclaim the reſt, and a hundred remedies might be applied, with hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But where the diſobedience is univerſal and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd by Authority, the diſeaſe is little better than deſperate.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106994:181"/> One had as good ſay, the Clergy are bound to keep the Laws, as long as they can do but a little harm by breaking them, and to break them when they can do a great deal. Let us put the caſe in his own Examples. If the Secular Power impoſe ſuch a rate on vendible things, or forbid carrying of Arms in the night, or tranſportation of Corn out of the Country, or the like, the Clergy are to obey as well as the reſt, till an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Law diſpoſe otherwiſe; very well. Let us ſuppoſe then that the Secular Power, by the Authority which it has in theſe things, has rated a pot of Ale at a penny; ſhould the Clergy out of Thrift or ſtubbornneſs pay but a half-penny, others would either grumble they ſhould have their drink cheaper, or perhaps ſell them none. To avoid this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they are <hi>directively</hi> obliged to pay a whole penny, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Eccleſiaſtical Law interpoſe not; but let that come, and ſet another rate, a half penny for Example, then they are <hi>Co-actively</hi> obliged to pay no more. Now I would fain know of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> how much leſs inconvenience there is, now the Clergy muſt pay but a half penny out of conſcience, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they would pay no more out of ſtubbornneſs. Will other people grumble leſs at the inequality, or will they get any more drink? For my part I ſuſpect the Ale-houſe-keepers will turn ſtubborn in their turns, and not afford them for their half penny what they can have a penny for of the Lay-good-fellows, who both directively and co-actively pay ſtill accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Secular rate. I doubt they will be forc'd to ſtrain a point of Conſcience, and for all the Eccleſiaſtical Law, and their obligation to ſtick to it, be even co-actively obliged to pay as others do, or remain thirſty. Go on if you pleaſe to the reſt with the imagination, for I will ſtay no longer here, and when you have conſidered the difference betwixt breaking the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of weapons, or Tranſporting Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by private Capricios, and publick and obligatory commands, tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bellarmin</hi> were not in a pleaſant humour, and had great care of the Commonwealth, when he made a little inconvenience rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to oblige the Clergy to keep the Civil Laws, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and makes it their duty to break them with twenty times a greater. I ſay nothing of the greateſt inconvenience of all, the acknowledging a Forreign Authority, which can oblige ſo great a number of perſons living within the bounds, and taken for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106994:181"/> members of the Common-wealth, as belong to the Clergy, to break all Laws even in Temporal things, becauſe at preſent I mind only how pat the reaſon is which he gives for his <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> obligation of the Clergy: Otherwiſe that <hi>Doctrine</hi> brings not only confuſion and trouble, but ruin to the common-wealth, and is abſolutely intolerable. But this is not a place for it.</p>
                     <p>To return into our Road, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us at laſt, that the Clergy and Laity have, even in Temporals, different Laws, a different Prince, and different Tribunals, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth which holds them, is in truth and formally two Common-wealths, though becauſe they all live in the ſame place, and under protection of the ſame Prince, it be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially one. Alſo that, in reſpect of the Clergy, Princes are not ſuperiour Powers, and therefore the Clergy are not bound to obey them neither by Divine, nor ſo much as Human right, unleſs <hi>Directively</hi> in certain caſes, as was ſaid before. This is full and home; for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> can ſpeak plain enough when he has a mind to it. But the Queſtion, and my Curioſity are now at an end. For I do not mean to be laught at by perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enquire, whether the Clergy be ſubject to him who is not their Prince, nor in reſpect of them a ſuperiour power. It is ſomething ſtrange though. By this account the Clergy are no more ſubjects to the Prince, in whoſe Dominions they live, than Aliens, who live in his Country under his protection. They are as much a new and ſtrange kind of Aliens, bred and born, and unmoveably ſetled in a Common-wealth; and yet Aliens ſtill. However it be, I have no more to ſay to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Deputys. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has acquitted them. It remains that he acquit himſelf: for as great a man as he is, ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and ſo important a Doctrine will hardly paſs upon his bare word.</p>
                     <p>He proves it both from Human and Divine Right. And I commend him for leaving nothing out; but think nevertheleſs I may deduct the one half, and confine my inquiry to Divine Right. For Human Right being either by Civil or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, what the Clergy have by Civil Laws, is ſo far from prejudicing their ſubjection, that it rather confirms it. For Receiving is an acknowledgment of the power from which they receive. Beſides Princes, whether they can or no, yet uſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106994:182"/> not to grant any thing derogatory from their own Soveraignty: or if they do, recal it on better conſideration. What in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar it is, which the Clergy have this way, we muſt enquire of thoſe who know the Laws; whatever it be, much good may it do them. Were all men of my mind, peradventure it ſhould be more than it is: for I am of opinion, they cannot be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted too much; and whatever ſerves, whether to preſerve or increaſe that reſpect, is the Laitys good as much as theirs, and perhaps more.</p>
                     <p>As for Eccleſiaſtical Laws, I conceive they need no place of their own at preſent, but may come in either with Civil or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. For if the ſtreſs be put only there, ſo that before the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws were made, the Clergy were Subjects, and had been ſo ſtill if thoſe Laws had not exempted them from ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Princes I ſuppoſe will expect their conſent ſhould be askt; Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this nature not binding without the concurrence of the Civil Power. And then the Queſtion will be, to what and how far the Civil power is engaged, which plainly belongs to Civil Right? But if the Eccleſiaſtical Law be ſuppoſed, not originally to give, but declare and preſs that exemption, as due to the Clergy by an antecedent Law of God or nature, the exemption is then refunded into that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Law, and there, as I conceive, it only pinches. Wherefore leaving <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s proofs from Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws, to thoſe who are skil'd and concern'd in them, I am only curious to know what kind of proofs he will bring from the Divine Law, which if it do command ſuch things as he affirms of the Clergy, truly, I have hitherto been very ill inſtructed in it. He divides them into the two branches of Poſitive and Natural Divine Law; either of which would have ſerv'd his turn; but he will needs undertake for both.</p>
                     <p>Beginning with the Poſitive, he deſires us firſt to obſerve, That <hi>by the Poſitive Law of God, he means not any command of God properly ſo called, which expreſly appears in Holy Writ, but what may by ſome ſimilitude be deduced from the Examples or Teſtimonys of the Old or New Teſtament.</hi> Now this ſeems to me a very inauſpicious beginning, and as much as to ſay, that by the <hi>Poſitive</hi> Law of God, he means the <hi>not-Poſitive</hi> Law of God. For pray what does <hi>Poſitive</hi> ſignifie? It is uſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> ſignifies the Law, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106994:182"/> Rule of Actions, imprinted in us by Reaſon; which inaſmuch as it is our nature, gives it the Title of <hi>Natural;</hi> inaſmuch as that nature proceeds from God, the Title of <hi>Divine.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it happens from the ſhortneſs, or corruption of nature, that what appears reaſonable to one, appears unreaſonable to another; this Rule becomes a kind of <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule, bent by our paſſions ſeveral waies. To remedy which miſchief, and not leave us altogether to the uncertain conduct of our erring Judgements, God in his mercy has expreſly declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, about what we are to do, or avoid, in the matters ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. This expreſs declaration is called his Poſitive Law, which ſupplys the defects of nature, and freeing us from groping blindly in the dark, and wrangling fruitleſly and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly about what is or is not our duty, ſets it in a clear light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and leaves us nothing to do but perform it.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo, I would fain learn of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there can be for the Poſitive Law of God, where there is no expreſs command of his, and we are left to our uncertain Deductions? What difference betwixt this, and the caſe of pure nature, and what ſhall hinder us from wrangling as long and to as little purpoſe, as if there were no ſuch thing as his Poſitive Law in the World? Nay though we could come to an end, ſince this end is to be made at laſt by the force of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſon, which can ſatisfie us of the Truth of the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it makes, why is not that end to be refunded rather into Reaſon, than the Law of God? We may poſſibly have ſome aſſiſtance from it towards the direction of our Reaſon. But Poſitive Law is one thing; the operations even of aſſiſted Reaſon another. And I cannot imagine how the operations of Reaſon ſhould by one that loves to ſpeak properly, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> does, be called the Law of God. Though it be the Law of God on which Reaſon works, yet it's Reaſon ſtill that works: and unleſs we have good ſecurity that our Reaſon is particularly directed in theſe operations, I know not why it may not fail us as well here as elſewhere. A body would think the ſad diſtractions which perplex the World in matters that concern the Law of God, are too good an Argument, that our Reaſon fails us no where more.</p>
                     <p>But that the World is a confident World, and the Cry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies great whatever the Wooll be, I ſhould wonder people
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106994:183"/> ſhould not fear to make ſo bold at every turn with God and his Law. For whoever is miſtaken in his reaſoning, plainly pins his own miſtakes upon unerring Truth; and who is not, has at moſt but hit upon a true concluſion in Divinity, which if he will call the Poſitive Law of God, he muſt have a language by himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> once in his life be infallible in his Logick, and have rightly deduc'd his concluſion from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whether it may be called the Poſitive Law of God or no, I acknowledge it is to be embrac'd, as all Truth is whatever name it have, and however we come by it. But I muſt needs avow, his credit is not great enough with me to engage my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs into the trouble of examining his Arguments. I ſee he cites Claſſical Authors, men of great names even among your ſelves, who know as little of the poſitive Law, he talks of, as my ſelf, and who poſitively deny there is any ſuch thing in the caſe.</p>
                     <p>By the way, one may perceive it was not Lightneſs, but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which drew <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to intitle his reaſonings to the Law of God. He had a mind to eſtabliſh the exemptions of the Clergy on that Baſis, which he was ſure was firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. But becauſe there was no ſuch Law to be found, to put his own deductions in its ſtead, was a forc'd put. And if a ſecond reaſon may be thought of, why he ſhould leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done what was impoſſible to be done, I ſuppoſe he might have ſome conſideration of the Gentlemen his Adverſarys. For it would have been a troubleſome buſineſs to have made out, how there ſhould be a poſitive Law of God, of which Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as himſelf, were ignorant, had he underſtood by it what others do.</p>
                     <p>But to let this paſs, till he and his Friends are agreed, I have no temptation to thruſt my ſelf into their quarrels. I do not think but they have ſomething ſtill to ſay for themſelves, for all he has urged againſt them. Till he have ſtopt their mouths, and left them without reply, I think I may take the liberty to think them as likely to be in the right as he, and unblameably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from him, as well as thoſe of his own party.</p>
                     <p>Again, People in this Age uſe not to perform altogether ſo much as they Promiſe: and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> does not promiſe more than ſome ſimilitude between the caſes he finds in the Scripture,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106994:183"/> and that of the Clergy now adaies. Though he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the uttermoſt, I ſuſpect the reſult would be little more than to make hard ſhift to bring an Argument againſt himſelf. He mentions in all four places of Scripture, whereof three, according to his own reckoning, amount but to this: The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> were exempted by the Poſitive Law, and therefore Prieſts, who are as good men as they, ought to be ſo too. I fear <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> will hardly be contented, though a man ſhould allow him all the exemptions which can be proved due to the <hi>Levites</hi> by the old Law. But I will not meddle with that matter. It is plain that God did expreſly give the <hi>Levites</hi> the exemptions mentioned in the old Law; it is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that there is no expreſs mention in the new Law of thoſe exemptions to the Clergy for which he contends. I ſee not why this does not evidently conclude, that God was not of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s mind, and intended not that the Clergy ſhould owe their exemptions to his Law. For otherwiſe, why did he not exempt them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly as he did the <hi>Levites?</hi> Unleſs we could ſwallow the Blaſphemy of imagining God was leſs careful of <hi>Prieſts</hi> than <hi>Levites:</hi> or when he came to deliver us a new Law, forgot to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert all he intended, and left it to be ſupplied by our whimſys. Theſe places, I think, prove the juſt contrary of what <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> would have, and that which follows is, that as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions of the <hi>Levites</hi> were by the poſitive Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are expreſly mentioned in it, ſo the Clergys exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions are not by the poſitive Law of God, becauſe there is no mention of them in it.</p>
                     <p>However it be, when I reflect that the Topick which, for want of a better, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is fain to chuſe, is <hi>à Simili,</hi> and that <hi>Like,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlike</hi> is to be found or made every where: when I reflect, that even this too dwindles into a <hi>quandam ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem,</hi> a thing which may be found in the moſt contrary things that are, for there is ſome kind of likeneſs even betwixt Fire and Water, I cannot ſee but that to meddle with it, is to begin an Inquiry which never will have end. For I believe Doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day will ſooner come, than he ſhall have made his caſes ſo like, that no difference can be found between them; and till he do, the Topick concludes not.</p>
                     <p>I turn me therefore to obſerve what work he will make with his Divine natural Law, which he firſt diſtinguiſhes into three

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106994:185"/> degrees. In the firſt, he places thoſe commands of nature, which are ſo clearly imprinted in mens hearts, that they need no Diſcipline or Art, but by the bare light of Reaſon, even without the help of new diſcourſe, are by all eſteemed Juſt. As that <hi>Good</hi> is to be deſired, <hi>Evil</hi> avoided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond degree, is of thoſe which follow from thoſe firſt principles as immediate concluſions, naturally flowing by an eaſie, evident and neceſſary conſequence; and which, as the former, need not Diſcipline or Art, but only ſimple diſcourſe, ſuch as all men may have. Of this kind he reckons the commands of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue. Now the Exemptions of the Clergy belong not to either of theſe two, but to a third Degree of natural commands, which he ſays are indeed deduced from the Law of nature, but by a conſequence neither abſolutely neceſſary, nor altogether evident, and which therefore ſtand in need of Humane Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be beholding to him who would tell me what this means. For I can make nothing of it, and am mightily afraid this unneceſſary, and unevident conſequence of his, has a third quality, and will prove unintelligible too. <hi>Deducing,</hi> I think, ſignifies diſcovering the connexion of two Terms between themſelves, becauſe they are both connected with one third. If that connexion be not ſeen, I ſhould think 'tis all one as if it were not: and if it be ſeen, then to him who ſees it, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I ſhould think again, that where there is no neceſſary conſequence, or connexion of Terms in the concluſion, there is no connexion of them with a Third in the Premiſes. For if there be, their connexion is as neceſſary, as the connexion of that Third with it ſelf, or its being what it is; ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence plainly is either neceſſary, or none. If this be ſo, a conſequence neither evident nor neceſſary, is evidently and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily no conſequence, and ſo far from communicating the force of the Law of nature to the concluſion, that it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates none at all.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore take away the learned Terms, and that which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, is in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> this, <hi>I would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Law of Nature commands the exemptions of the Clergy, which it may do for ought I know, though I neither ſee it does, nor any neceſſity why it ſhould. But yet I would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, becauſe I find it would be very convenient it ſhould be ſo.</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106994:185"/> Though this found not altogether ſo amuſingly as in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yet I fancy it might be as efficacious. For plain dealing is a taking thing, and might perhaps work with many; but when you ſet upon them with dint of Argument, people ſtand upon their guard, and to attempt them with unneceſſary and unſeen conſequences, is a deſperate buſineſs, when the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſary in the World often fails of ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf does not truſt his Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this time; For he ſays, they <hi>ſtand in need of Humane Conſtitution.</hi> And I pray for what is this Humane Conſtitution needful? Is it to make the not evident, and not neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, evident and neceſſary, and make that follow from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles, which does not follow from natural Principles? This indeed is what needs: but 'tis more than Humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution can do. For Concluſions follow from the ſeen Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Premiſes, and all the Authority of all mankind put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can never make that be seen, which is not to be ſeen, or an Identity where there is a difference. Or does he mean that Humane Conſtitution is needful to make the Concluſion, which cannot prevail by its own ſtrength, be accepted in vertue of the conſtitutive Authority? This indeed Humane conſtitution can do; for it matters not whether the concluſion be well or ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if thoſe who can command, will have it obey'd. But then what is eſtabliſhed this way ſtands wholly upon Humane, and not at all on Natural Right, farther than as Nature or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the ground of all Laws. For take away the Humane conſtitution, nature is ſo far from obliging any body to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence confeſſedly unconcluding, that on the contrary it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him not to accept it, he being not true to his Reaſon, which is his nature, who does. This being plain, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe does <hi>Bellarmin</hi> keep ſuch ado with the Law of nature, when he meant to reſolve all into the pure Law of man at laſt?</p>
                     <p>I ſhould gueſs, by the hint he gives preſently after, that he had a mind to make his Exemptions unalterable; for he infers, that what depends on the Law of Nations, which he makes equivalent to his third branch, cannot be abrogated or changed by Princes, becauſe it is in ſome ſort natural. This would have founded ſomething like, if he had not told us what he meant. But the miſcheif is, we know before-hand, that his <hi>in ſome ſort natural,</hi> means deduc'd from Nature neither evidently nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106994:186"/> and that ſignifying not deduc'd, the ſort which he calls natural, ſignifies a ſort of ſtanding upon nature, ſo as not to ſtand upon nature, but upon the needful humane Authority, that is a not natural ſort. And then, becauſe his Exemptions can be no otherwiſe unchangeable than as they are natural, there is neither evidence nor neceſſity of their unchangeableneſs, and ſo the moſt that can be ſaid of them, is that they are unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſome ſort likewiſe, namely in ſuch ſort as they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that is, in a not unchangeable, or changeable ſort.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when we come to caſt up accounts with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and ſee what his Divine Right amounts to, we find that what he calls Divine Poſitive Law, is, even by his confeſſion, no Law of God, but deductions from the worſt and moſt hopeleſs of Topicks. Which who will go about to examine, had need be a man of great leiſure, and who can promiſe himſelf a great age; otherwiſe his attempt will be deſperate: and what he calls Divine Natural Law, is likewiſe no Law of Nature, but Deductions like the former, as weak and as endleſs, and which to ſave us the fruitleſs trouble of examining, he fairly gives us warning are unconcluding, And this is Divine Right in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>'s language.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe Truth has influence on the actions of men, not as it is in it ſelf, but as it appears to them, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not ſo much what is, as what is apprehended; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s proofs be never ſo bad, if you apprehend them good, 'tis all one as if they were perfect Demonſtrations. Tell me then what you think of the matter; what you believe, and what you do in this point; whether <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the Church be of the ſame mind, and all the immunities attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by him to the Clergy, paſs among you for unqueſtionably Divine and Unalterable Right. And remember our Queſtion is not whether they have exemptions or no. Every body ſees they are, and ought be free from divers burthens of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ſince otherwiſe they could not live a Clerical life, as 'tis neceſſary, even for the good of the Laity they ſhould. But the queſtion is, what thoſe Exemptions are, and how They come by them. For my part I ſhould think that if any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption claimed or enjoy'd by them, be diſcovered harmful to the Common-wealth, ſuch an exemption is neither neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Clerical life, nor commanded by God. In particular
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106994:186"/> I ſee no neceſſity of their exemption from Secular Tribunals, and conceive they might be very good Clergy men without it. What prejudice can it be to the Dignity and perfection of their ſtate, to be aw'd from doing ill by fear of puniſhment? To do ill is the greateſt prejudice to both; how being reſtrained from prejudicing their ſtate, ſhould be a prejudice to their ſtate, is beyond my underſtanding. They are but men, as much the beſt men as They ought to be, and to have their frailty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to one Temptation more than the reſt of mankind, and that the ſtrongeſt of Temptations, Impunity, is, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, far from a Benefit. I think he is not their Friend who exempts them from fear of puniſhment, unleſs he exempt them too from the poſſibility of deſerving it.</p>
                     <p>Again, would They do any thing misbecoming their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if They paid their ſhares in Publick Taxes? They who are to wean the hearts of the Laity from affection to Riches, and the reſt of periſhable goods, ſhould rather ſet them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Doctrine: and are like to be heard but ill, when they Preach on that ſubject, if they be known to love Riches themſelves, and refuſe, in the neceſſities of the common-wealth, to part with what the wiſdom of it judges they may ſpare. Either ſhew me that a Clergy man cannot live as a Clergy man ſhould, without ſuch exemptions as theſe, or I ſhall never believe they are commanded by the Law of God or Nature.</p>
                     <p>Then the Tenure, by which they hold what they have, is to be conſider'd. Not but what they have purely from the Piety and Liberality of men is truly theirs, and to look upon it with regret, is Envy, and to take it cauſleſly away, Injuſtice. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding though there were no more in the caſe, it is a point of Gratitude to acknowledge our Benefactors. But if we reflect, that Divine Right is an unmoveable Baſis, on which whatever ſtands can never be ſtirred; Humane Right is ſubject to the contingency of Humane things; it will appear of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable importance, on which of the two the exemptions of the Clergy be ſettled; for it may happen, that what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in one time and place, may be inconvenient elſewhere, and in another ſeaſon. Now 'tis in Human Authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a remedy for whatever inconvenience change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhall produce in Exemptions derived from Human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106994:187"/> But if all be thought to flow from a Divine Spring, let the waters be never ſo troubled, or corrupt, never ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, or overflow with never ſo much prejudice, the miſchief is without remedy, By the way, ſince no ill can proceed from the Fountain of Good, if any Exemption bring miſchief along with it, that Exemption confutes it ſelf, and needs no ſecond Argument to evidence it has no warrant from God or Nature. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> now ſays, They are of Divine Right all: Reaſon ſays ſome, at leaſt, are harmful to Princes, harmful to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, harmful to the Clergy themſelves: what ſays the Church? Is ſhe for <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or Reaſon? You and I have kept a great coyl to little purpoſe, if ſhe ſtand faſt to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and all our paſt labour is e'en much ado about nothing.</p>
                     <p>For what avails it to ſhut up the great gate of Direct, and back door of Indirect Power, if there be ſtill a way under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground to get into the houſe? All hitherto ſaid in behalf of Princes is, that the Pope cannot take away their Kingdoms for any cauſe. What is this better than a Cheat, if he can, even without any cauſe, take away their ſubjects? For what is a Kingdom good for, and indeed what is it but the ſubjects? Conſider what a Prince he were, into whoſe Dominions ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers might enter in what numbers they pleaſed without his leave, and plant, and ſettle themſelves, and live without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him; And tell me what difference there is, whether thoſe men be ſtrangers or natives. This is at leaſt a partial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, a fair ſtep to a total, and in ſome reſpect worſe. For that may be avoided by a Prince, who will alwaies do what the Pope pleaſes, and give him no hold, ſince it cannot be put in practice without Demerit. But from this no, even, Merit can preſerve any Prince. The Pope not only may, but of neceſſity muſt depoſe him from all Soverainty over as many as belong to the Clergy. And how far may that carry? Exemptions, if I miſtake not, are extended to the Families of Clergy-men too, and ſo as many ſervants as they take, ſo many ſubjects the Prince loſes. What if they ſhould ſtretch it a little farther to honorary ſervants too, and bring exemptions into faſhion as well as Protections? I ſhould wonder if all this, and twenty times as much, might not be deduc'd from the Law of Nature too, in <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s method, inevidently and unneceſſarily. What if they ſhould yield ſometimes to the frailty of nature,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106994:187"/> and out of Avarice or Revenge, take their Neighbours Goods or life? If they cannot be Indited, but are exempt from that Fear, which is the great ſecurity men in community have of their Lives and Fortunes, I ſuſpect 'twill not be good living too near a Clergy-man.</p>
                     <p>But to leave ſuch unlikely Speculations, the Clergy, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Countries, where Religious abound, are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable even in number; and every where in quality, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they have over the people, more I believe than any other kind of thoſe into which the people are divided. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what fine doings there would be, if the moſt conſiderable part of a Nation owe no ſubjection to the Prince, no contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to the common neceſſities, no obedience to the Laws, in ſhort, be a part of the Nation, and no part of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. What Title have they to the benefits of it, who bear no ſhare in the burthens? What to the protection of Laws, who break them at pleaſure? What pretence to ſecurity in the enjoyment of their Goods, from which they, who ſecure them, can promiſe themſelves no aſſiſtance upon occaſion? Other mens eſtates are ſo theirs, that they are more the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, which can at any time take as much of them, as the publick neceſſities require. With what comes to the Clergy, ſhe has no more to do, more than to keep it ſafe to them, that they may keep it ſafe from her, and be a Guard for them againſt her ſelf. Conſider what this imports. I miſtake, if I have not heard of times and places, in which a fourth part of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the whole has been in the Clergys hands. Riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrength of a Nation, that Nation was plainly a fourth part weaker, than it would have been otherwiſe. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the proportion, what the Clergy gets the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth loſes, and I ſuſpect there are few which can with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bate any part of their ſtrength. I will ſay no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that you ſee enough what I would be at. Either dam up the Spring, if you judge, as I do, the waters unwholſome, or ſhew they are wholſom. Chuſe which you pleaſe, only let me not long bear the burthen of the impatient curioſity which is now upon</p>

                     <p>YOU have the pleaſant'ſt Fancys! To hear you talk, a man would think Princes could not Rule, nor People live in quiet, and the World in danger of being turn'd Topſy Turvy, and all for a Page or two in <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> The Book has been out a pretty while, and twenty more perhaps have ſince ſaid as much, perhaps more than he, and yet we make a ſhift, thanks be to God, to live ſtill, and the World ſtaggers on the uſual reeling pace. What is it alarms you thus? Your Clergy pretend to none of thoſe things which diſquiet you; and let ours pretend what they will, you know well enough how to deal with them. While you order them as you think fit, 'tis no great matter how they think of themſelves. To ſee the different Judgments of men. This Queſtion, which to you appears ſo important, and ſo neceſſary, to me ſeems not ſo much as ſeaſonable. There is no time wherein people ſhould not be wary what they ſay of thoſe, whoſe office it is to keep alive the Sacred fire rain'd down from Heaven on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and preſs upon us the concerns of the next life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all the advantages of this are not only uſeleſs, but harmful. But in an Age not at all favourable, and hardly juſt to them, when all the weight we can throw into their ſcale will ſcarce keep the ballance even, methinks 'tis very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take any out. All your mighty concern, and all your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſhould never move me to do it. But I conſider that Falſhood weighs not; or if it do, 'tis on the contrary ſide. For the advantages ſought from Untruth, turn to diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at laſt. The Clergy have Prerogatives eſtabliſh'd by the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, which raiſe them, as 'tis fit they ſhould be, above the reſt of mankind. Who ſeeks to increaſe them by ungrounded fancys, is not their Friend. 'Tis as if a man ſhould go about to enlarge his houſes with new buildings on a bad foundation, which will certainly fall themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides endanger to pull down part of the old with them. Who graſps at what is not his, hazards to loſe what is. For ſuch is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106994:189"/> the malice of the World, when we have once found a hole in our Neighbours Coat, within a while he may chance to have never a whole piece. If reaſon warrant us to except againſt any one, our perverſeneſs will tempt us to except againſt every thing: And ſo we actually ſee there is Confidence, I was about to ſay Impudence, enough in the World to make even Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments common to the Laity. I know not whether this be not the true, at leaſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Reaſon of the complaints of this Age. However it be, I am perſwaded that to diſcover what is unſound in the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, whether pretended by, or obtruded upon, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, is to deſerve well at their hands, and the beſt, and perhaps only way, to make what is ſound more ſtable and laſting. This perſwaſion, more than your earneſtneſs, prevails with me to do as you would have me, and tell you what I think of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with all the ſincerity and plainneſs I can.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, I think, whatever be of the concluſion, <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Arguments are not good, and prove not Divine Right, either Poſitive or Natural; in which, we being all agreed of Human Right, the only difficulty lies. It would ſave me ſome pains, if I ſhifted them off as you do, with quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling at the Topicks. But I conſider, that though an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>à Simili</hi> be none of the ſureſt, and often fail, yet it may hit, and the Topick is allow'd among the reſt in Logick. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to reject an Argument, and not ſay particularly why, is not altogether ſo fair play. But pray expect not I ſhould be as ſmart as you. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> never comes in your way, but you muſt have a Bout at ſharps with him. I muſt confeſs he has given you ſome cauſe to bear him no great good will, but none to fall ſtill into your <hi>Burleſque</hi> fits. For ought I perceive you would be as much at a loſs for ſport without <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as ſome Pulpits for matter without the Pope. They are a pair of Gentlemen without whom, as hardly as you treat them, it ſeems you would not know what to do. Why cannot you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of his ſober ſtile, and my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi>'s advice, to treat controverſie with the ſoftneſs of Love Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? I have told you of this before, and cannot help it, if you will not out of your way. But you ſhall go alone for me. I like it not ſo well to keep you company in it.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106994:189"/>
                     <p>To come to the matter; in proof of Divine Poſitive Law, there are in all four places alledged by <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> The two firſt are <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. where <hi>Joſeph</hi> exempted the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts, and 1 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 7. where <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> exempted the Prieſts of the Jews. Theſe two indeed he touches but gently, and he has reaſon. The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts avoided the neceſſity of ſelling their Lands, by the allowances of Corn they had out of the Publick Granaries: <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> took from his Officers the power of impoſing Tributes upon the Jewiſh Prieſts and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and theſe things are recorded in Scripture. This is the whole matter of fact, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> barely hints, but ſays nothing to apply it to his purpoſe. I for my part, ſee not how it can be apply'd, unleſs it be firſt ſuppoſed that every thing contained in Scripture, even in the Hiſtorical parts, is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by God. And that is ſo far from true, that we ſee there are blameable and vicious actions inſerted in the Sacred Hiſtory as well as good. Not to go out of our preſent matter, who will make theſe examples equivalent to a poſitive Law of God, muſt likewiſe ſay it is the poſitive Law of God, that care be taken for the ſubſiſtence and priviledges of Idolatrous Prieſts (for ſo were the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>) and that Miniſters of ſtate turn all Subjects into Slaves as ſoon as they get opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe places are indeed againſt <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> For 'tis plain that both <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> had what they had, from their ſeveral Princes. And this I think is not proof of Divine Right for Exemptions, but Divine Teſtimony that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Human.</p>
                     <p>To theſe two places borrowed from the Gloſs upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, out of deference, I ſuppoſe, more than needed to the Authority of the Gloſſator, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> adds two more of his own. The firſt from <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. where the <hi>Levites</hi> are by Gods appointment given to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succeſſors; and God ſays ſeveral times expreſly of them, <hi>They are mine.</hi> Were no body wiſer than I, this place would prove no more than what need: no Scripture to prove it, it is ſo clear of it ſelf: <hi>viz.</hi> That they belong to God in a ſpecial manner, whoſe whole buſineſs it is to attend to his ſervice. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove out of it, a total exemption of the Clergy from the Tribunals of Princes. His diſcourſe is this, <hi>For thoſe whom God choſe for himſelf, to the Miniſtry of the Temple, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106994:190"/> Holy things, He would have Subjects to the High Prieſt alone, who repreſented the place of God on Earth, and by this freed them from the Juriſdiction of the Princes of the Earth.</hi> To ſee how differently the ſame things will appear to different men! Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his place would have concluded quite contrary, and thought it plain enough, ſince the thing for which God choſe the <hi>Levites</hi> is expreſt to be the Miniſtry over which <hi>Aaron</hi> was appointed, that the ſubjection of the <hi>Levites</hi> to <hi>Aaron</hi> is reſtrained to the Miniſtry, leaving them in other reſpects as they were before.</p>
                     <p>However this is plain, that the whole force of his diſcourſe lies in the word <hi>Alone,</hi> and 'tis plain that he has put in that word purely of his own head, without any manner of warrant from the Text, and beſides manifeſtly contrary to what daily paſſes before our eyes. For nothing is more ordinary in the World, than for the ſame man to owe ſubjection to ſeveral powers in ſeveral reſpects. At School we obey our Maſters, at home our Parents; and yet Scholars and Children, Maſters and Parents, and all are ſubject to the Magiſtrate. In what relates to our health, we obey the Phyſician; in Sea matters, the Pilot; in the concerns of our Fortune, the Lawyer; the Prince, as well as others, is guided by them in ſuch things, and yet all remain his Subjects. The Laity, as well as Clergy are ſubject to the Spiritual power in Spirituals, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing their ſubjection to the Temporal in Temporals. But 'tis idle to dilate on a thing ſo known and ſo obvious. It is enough to ſay that This, whether Argument or Suppoſition of <hi>Bellarmin, The Levites were ſubject to</hi> Aaron, <hi>therefore they were ſubject to him alone,</hi> is wholly ungrounded.</p>
                     <p>In what related to the Miniſtry, They were indeed to obey <hi>Aaron:</hi> in other things, for ought appears, they were ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject even to the Judges appointed by the advice of <hi>Jethro,</hi> and much more to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf. Only he has ſet it off to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by ſaying, the High Prieſt <hi>repreſented the place of God on Earth:</hi> which ſounds magnificently and awfully: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, every Prince, and every Magiſtrate, and every Superiour repreſent the place of God too, as far as his power goes. And for <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, it is expreſly confin'd by the Text to the ſervice of the Miniſtry. When the Army reſted, the <hi>Levites</hi> were to receive orders from him about officiating in the Tabernacle, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106994:190"/> when it marched about carrying what belonged to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: yet none, I believe ever fancy'd, but that the orders to reſt, and when, and which way, and how far to march, were given by ſome body beſides <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other, and only place out of the New Teſtament, is <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. about the Tribute, which our Saviour paid, but with a declaration that the Children of Kings are free. To ſave the trouble of turning over more Books, let us e'en refer this matter to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf. He tells us there are two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of this place: ſome underſtanding it of a payment made every year to the Temple, others of an impoſition laid by the <hi>Romans.</hi> According to the firſt, the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſays is this, <hi>The Kings of the Earth require not Tribute of their Children, therefore neither will the King of Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Tribute of me, who am his true and natural Son.</hi> This he thinks the true ſence of the place; but withal, that the Argument holds too in the other expoſition, according to which it runs in this manner. <hi>The Princes of the Earth are but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the King of Heaven, and therefore ought not require Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his Son.</hi> According to both, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſes that the force of our Saviours diſcourſe lies in this, that He was the natural Son of God. and that I think is to confeſs, that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to any other, is to take away its force.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, He will needs extend it to all the Clergy. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when the Sons of Kings are exempted from Tribute, not their perſons alone, but their Servants and Officers, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are exempted likewiſe.</hi> Whether this may be ſaid or no, methinks it is not for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to ſay it. For in his judgment what our Saviour ſaid, related to a Tribute required by God. Wherefore if he apply it to Tributes impoſed by Secular Princes, he acts againſt his judgment. However, it is <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> who ſpeaks now, not Chriſt. Chriſt ſpoke only of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; we hear nothing from him of Servants and Families, but barely of the Sons of Kings; and becauſe we do not, have reaſon to believe, he meant not they ſhould be comprehended in his diſcourſe; for if he had, he would undoubtedly have comprehended them himſelf: and if it had been his pleaſure to have his Family exempted, as he was himſelf, he would have ſignified it. It is manifeſt therefore, that what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, is without any warrant from Scripture. Beſides, which ill
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106994:191"/> becomes his learning, it is aſſuming for proof the very point to be proved. For calling the Clergy the Family of Chriſt, as he does in the following words, it is all one to ask whether the Clergy, or whether Chriſt's Family be exempted. Wherefore to aſſume without proof, as he plainly does, that Chriſt's Family is exempt, is to aſſume without proof that the Clergy are exempt. The place then teaches the Divinity of Chriſt, and to recede even from our right, rather than ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our Neighbour; the reſt is ungrounded fancy.</p>
                     <p>As for what he adds, that our Saviour, by paying for <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeems to intimate, his Family too was free: I know not what may ſeem to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> but am ſure it does not ſeem ſo to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body. If that had been our Saviours reaſon, it ſeems he ſhould have paid for the reſt of the Apoſtles as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> who were all of the Family as well as he. Since they were left to the ordinary courſe of things, it ſeems to be our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours pleaſure, that his Family ſhould be left ſo, whatever were his reaſon to pay for <hi>Peter.</hi> I might paſs over St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom he alledges; ſince they ſay nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But to diſſemble nothing, that which they ſay is this, That <hi>the Clergy do not pay Tribute, for the honour of God, and as being Children of the King of Heaven.</hi> And this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly true, when Princes for the honour of God have exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. And it would be as true of the Laity, under a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Prince, who ſhould exempt them all, as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did the Jewiſh Prieſts. For even They are the Sons of God too, and Co-heirs of Chriſt. But that the exemption, of which the Fathers ſpeak, was by the poſitive Law of God, which is the only queſtion, neither of them do ſo much as ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                     <p>He ends with ſome quotations out of Councils, with which I have no mind to meddle, it being to enter into the Queſtion of the Authority of Councils. It will be enough to ſay briefly, that if his Councils be ſo circumſtanc'd, as he himſelf requires they ſhould be to engage our belief, and mean as he does, he has made a down-right Article of Faith of his opinion, and cannot allow for Catholick Authors, thoſe who he ſays think otherwiſe. But this is more than even himſelf pretends. The Councils he cites, all but that of <hi>Trent,</hi> are not free from exemption, I think in his own opinion. And the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106994:191"/> Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays, Eccleſiaſtical Immunities were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as ſome others ſpeak, but <hi>Ordinatione Divina, &amp; Eccleſiaſticis Sanctionibus.</hi> He would perſwade us the Council ſpeaks in this manner, leaſt people by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> ſhould underſtand <hi>Canon Law,</hi> which for all <hi>Panormitan,</hi> who he ſays confutes it, is a Tenet ordinary enough. But by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, conſidering how tender the Council was all along to meddle with points controverted among Catholicks, it is a great deal more likely the Council made choice of that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to leave thoſe who are for <hi>Jure Humano</hi> to their liberty. For even they cannot except againſt that expreſſion, ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens in the World, by whatever means, happens by Divine Ordination. Wherefore the Council, as far as I can ſee, is ſo far from ſettling <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s opinion, that it allows the contrary. However it be, <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic ſaltas. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> undertakes to ſhew us the poſitive Law of God for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions. Let him do this, and not tell us what others think, or ſay of the matter, even in Council. For this is not the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs now.</p>
                     <p>This is all that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays upon this Head. But that he liv'd in a place where the Doctrine of Exemptions ran with a ſtrong Current, and ſo in likelihood was carried away with the ſtream, it is ſtrange a man of his parts ſhould engage for any thing, for which he had ſo little to ſay. He fairly confeſſes at firſt there is no expreſs command for what he would perſwade us is the poſitive Law of God: and every body may ſee there is as little in his Arguments, as in the Text. At leaſt he ſaw ſo much himſelf. For the moſt he attributes to them is bare Probability. Which is to ſay in plain Engliſh, It may be 'tis ſo, it may be 'tis not ſo: I know not whether it be or no. 'Twere ill with the World if the Poſitive Law of God come once to <hi>May be's.</hi> Nor does it conſiſt with his Providence to leave us groping in the dark to find out what his pleaſure is with our uncertain gueſſes, and hit right and get to Heaven, if luck ſerve. For all our hopes of Heaven depend upon the obſervance of his Law, and if we have no better ſecurity of it than <hi>May be,</hi> 'tis pure chance whether we go to Heaven or Hell, and we may e'en throw Dice for our Salvation. In ſhort, Theſe are Arguments of the power of Prejudice and nothing elſe. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> I doubt, was deep in when he made
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106994:192"/> them. Who thinks them concluding, has a better opinion of them than He had, and muſt needs be in deeper.</p>
                     <p>And ſo we are come to the Arguments, by which he would intitle his Exemptions to Divine Natural Law. The firſt is the Cuſtom of Nations; which ſeems rather Inſtance than Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. He had reſolved the Divine Right which he pretends into the Law of Nations, and now goes about to ſhew that ſeveral Nations have practic'd according to it. I muſt confeſs this ſubſtituting the Law of Nations for Divine Natural Law, will not down with me. It is promiſing one thing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming another. For all the World thinks them different, and he himſelf among the reſt diſtinguiſhes them as Principles from Concluſions.<note place="margin">In quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatur à le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge naturali per modum concluſionis quae non eſt multum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mota à principijs, St. <hi>Thom. 1.2.</hi> q. <hi>5.</hi> art. <hi>4.</hi> ad. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> Which Concluſions, if you will believe St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> muſt not be far off neither. Put them as he does, at ſuch a diſtance, that there is no evident, no neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them, and no body but himſelf can imagine they have any thing to do with the Law of Nature. But there being no need to ravel into that matter, let it paſs. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> quotes for the Jews <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. for the Gentiles, <hi>Ariſtotle, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch:</hi> for Chriſtians, a Law of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and another of <hi>Juſtinian:</hi> not forgetting the forementioned inſtances of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which it ſeems he thinks prove both Poſitive and Natural Law too. To ſift all theſe quotations minutely, would prove a buſineſs, and I love to ſpare my pains. I conceive we are to ſet aſide what he alledges from <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Numbers.</hi> For that the <hi>Levites</hi> paid not their half Sicle to the uſes of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: and that the reſt did, belongs not to the Natural but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law of God. For the reſt, all he ſaies is, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been done for the Clergy in all the Nations he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now becauſe he took care before-hand, leaſt we ſhould miſtake, to admoniſh us, that there is no evident nor neceſſary Light of Nature to guide Nations in this particular, it remains that the Clergy were beholding to the Civil power for what they had. And this every body will freely grant him without troubling his Quotations.</p>
                     <p>Methinks this difference might be compounded. Rather than fall out, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhall have it his own way for me. With all my heart let the Cuſtome of Nations carry it. I am ſure he is not ſo unreaſonable, as to require that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106994:192"/> ſhould be bound by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Laws, or <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by the <hi>Gaules,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by any of them. Let the Clergy then be treated by every Nation according to their own Laws or Cuſtomes, and the buſineſs is at an end.</p>
                     <p>But 'twere good we underſtood one another. A Clergy man is not only a neceſſary man in a Common-wealth, but one who ſpends his whole life in the ſervice of it. For the good of particulars, is the good of the whole, and his whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to perfect particulars. Now becauſe it is impoſſible, that who ſpends all his time in one employment, ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low another, it is plain, that nothing is to be required of a Clergy-man, but the work of a Clergy-man. Whatever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings others follow, whether by inclination, or for advantage, or perhaps by conſtraint, none can be put upon the Clergy-man but his own. I except caſes of neceſſity, where Clergy-men too ſometimes turn Souldiers. This is not to undertake a new calling, but to ſuſpend their own, and that for a ſhort time. As ſoon as the neceſſity is over, They are as they were before. Nay a Clergy-man cannot live as a Clergy-man, if he be forc'd to labour ſo much as for his living. 'Tis true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon occaſion ſet his hand to Tent-making after he was an Apoſtle. But to follow his example, I think one ſhould be in his circumſtances, extraordinarily and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and without his own labour, capacitated for his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Otherwiſe, who muſt take the ordinary way of ſtudy, will find there goes ſo much time to get the knowledge, which is requiſite for him; ſo much to preſerve it; ſo much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it: that there will be none to ſpare for any thing elſe. Regularly ſpeaking 'tis neceſſary Proviſion be made for him out of our Saviours ſtock, <hi>Dignus eſt operarius mercede ſuâ.</hi> The Clergy-man is therefore, by the incompatibility of them with his function, exempted from the Duties of other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and has a good title from Nature to ſuch exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For Nature plainly teaches that who has his full load, ought not carry more. And this is common to all Vocations as well as the Clergy. Who is obliged to fight for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is exempt from Tilling the Ground; who adminiſters Juſtice, from fighting: and ſo of the reſt. No body I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive would have any thing to ſay to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> for deriving the Exemptions of the Clergy from Nature, if this were what he meant by Exemptions.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106994:193"/>
                     <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether the Exemptions he pretends, <hi>In rebus politicis tum quoad perſonas, tum quod Bona,</hi> as he ſpeaks, be taught by Nature? Truly, I am a very ill Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in Natures School, if they be. Subjection in both ſeems ſo far from incompatible with their function, that I ſee not how it is prejudicial, and conceive They may paſs very well without thoſe exemptions, and better than with them. I perceive nothing in his Argument towards opening my eyes. That which he ſaies is indeed true. Many Nations, all if he pleaſe, have given exemptions to the Clergy, ſuch as they were: neither do we need Inſtances to prove a thing has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which we know before-hand by Reaſon muſt have happened. But it is nothing to the purpoſe: for we are not a jot the nearer knowing that his exemptions are due to the Clergy from Nature, by knowing that they have had exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all Nations. When he proves that his Exemptions are of the number of thoſe, which the Clergy has enjoy'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and every where, he will have ſpoken to the Queſtion. But 'tis too much to expect we ſhould believe no Nation has ever meddled with their Perſons and Goods, when he goes not about to prove it ſo much as of any one. The truth is, the Argument is as plain a Sophiſm as can be. Exemptions have been uſed in all Nations, therefore theſe Exemptions have been in all Nations, is juſt the ſame as if he ſhould Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Drink is uſed in all Nations, therefore Wine is uſed in all Nations. I conceive therefore I may let his Quotations alone, till they be applyed to his purpoſes, and in the mean time content my ſelf with ſeeing that the Argument is nothing to the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument compares the Eccleſiaſtical and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Powers to the Spirit and Fleſh in man. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>though it hinder not the actions of the Fleſh, when they are as they ſhould be, yet governs and moderates it, ſometimes keeping it back, ſometimes urging it forward, as it judges expedient for its own end. But the Fleſh has no power over the Spirit, nor can direct, or judge, or reſtrain it in any thing. So the Eccleſiaſtical Power, which is Spiritual, and by that means naturally Superiour to the Secular, may, when 'tis needful, direct, judge, and reſtrain it, but by no means be directed, judged, or reſtrained by it.</hi> This out-runs the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106994:193"/> Conſtable. By this account the Laity are ſubject to the Clergy in all things, and the Clergy to the Laity in nothing. Which if it be true, Exemptions are a pitiful matter not worth talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. For what need has an intire Superiority of Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Nay, with what good ſence can they be applyed to it? An Inferiour indeed cannot command his Superior; but to ſay the Superiour is exempt from the Inferiour, is a new language. We ſay he is above him, not exempt from him. This Doctrine turns the ſcales ſtrangely. Inſtead of inquiring whether the Clergy be exempt from the Laity, as far as I ſee, the Laity will be put to their ſhifts to get Exemptions from the Clergy. However it be, that which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> aſſumes, is a great deal more than that which he would prove by it, and more ado there will be to get it paſs. For the Laity, who conteſt even Exemptions, will never be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a total Superiority without unreſiſtable conviction, unleſs that Superiority be reſtrained to Spirituals, which as it was never conteſted, ſo it hinders not the Superiority which they claim in Temporals.</p>
                     <p>As for the Argument, it were an eaſie matter to get rid of it by a blunt denial. For how does it appear, that the two Powers are to one another, as the Spirit and the Fleſh? St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi> ſaid ſo in a certain Sermon, and others have taken it upon his credit. Be it ſo. How does it appear that St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and thoſe who follow him are not all miſtaken? 'Twere ſomething harſh to ſay ſo; but yet who did, were at an end of the Argument. For there is no other proof, ſave a hint of what he has done in his Book <hi>de Pont.</hi> where he only tells the ſame ſtory more at large.</p>
                     <p>But to uſe St. <hi>Gregory</hi> with more reſpect, let us reflect that a Preacher is one thing, a Diſputer another: and therefore what may be very proper for St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> may ill become <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi> For many things are very plauſible, and very pat in a Pulpit, which will not endure the Teſt of a ſevere examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on elſewhere. And this happens no more ordinarily than in ſimilitudes. For being generally uſed, not ſo much to prove, as to imprint lively in the minds of the Auditory what is proved otherwiſe, they loſe both their beauty and force when they are rack'd into ſevere proofs. I have not St. <hi>Gregory</hi> by me, to ſpeak with certainty of his meaning, or know how
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106994:194"/> much he ſays of what is put upon him. But I ſee, as much ſimilitude as he found to his purpoſe, the caſes are unlike enough. The Fleſh indeed is ſubject to the Spirit, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acted by it, becauſe taken in contradiſtinction to it. It is a meer dead clod, which does nothing at all. And though it could: to govern, and direct, and judge, are Actions quite out of its ſphere, and of which the Spirit alone is capable. Did St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> does <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, or any man in his ſences, think in earneſt it is ſo between the two Powers? Is not the Secular as active as the Spiritual? Nay, is not this all the complaint, that it is too active? Can it not govern, and direct, and judge as truly? On the one ſide therefore we have an Agent and no Agent, on the other two Agents: and yet he would perſwade us that theſe caſes are alike, and that St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> thought ſo.</p>
                     <p>But let the Similitude be what it will, what is it to us? What have we to do with Powers, who are talking of men? It will be time enough to inquire how the Powers are to one another, when it is our buſineſs. At preſent we have other work in hand. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaies, the Clergy are exempted from Puniſhment and Tribute. This Clergy are men, and we are examining whether what he ſays of them be true. Let him not amuſe us with Powers. Powers do not pay Tribute, or appear at the Bar. Nor does the Secular Magiſtrate, or power, pretend to judge, or reſtrain the Spiritual power. Marry to the man who has it, when by criminal Actions he becomes unworthy of it, the Secular Magiſtrate does pretend he has ſomething to ſay. And he may ſay what he will for <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> For he takes no further care than for the Power, which no body offers to touch, but leaves the poor man in the lurch. And ſo this ſimilitude which ſo much pleaſes <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> that he has it up at every turn, is as bad an Argument as can be. It is neither proved, nor any thing to purpoſe if it were.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, here is a plain buſineſs clouded with learned handling. Take away the Scholaſtical appearances of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fathers, ſimilitudes and Arguments, and who can tell ten, can ſee all that is in it. Every body knows there are two powers in the World, the Spiritual and the Temporal, and every body knows men are ſubject to both. This is no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106994:194"/> news. Now we muſt needs be told that the Spiritual power is to the Temporal, as the Spirit to the Fleſh. Which if it ſignifie that the Spiritual power is, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> phraſes it, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuperiour to the Temporal, and ſo the Temporal acts with the leave and according to the pleaſure of the Spiritual, it is manifeſtly falſe. For the Powers are both ſupreme, and independent of one another, as we have diſcours'd formerly. Nor can St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of all men, be thought to mean ſo, who if <hi>Caron</hi> cite him right, ſays, the Temporal power is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>(Summa)</hi> and full, and liable to the pleaſure or command of no other. Beſides that elſewhere, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly includes himſelf in the number of thoſe who are to obey the higher powers for conſcience, and in force of a Law clearly promulgated by the Holy Ghoſt. But if it ſignifie that all men, even thoſe who have the greateſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power are ſubject to the Spiritual, it is very true. The Sword which Kings bear exempts them not from the Keys. In this ſenſe I gueſs St. <hi>Gregory</hi> meant it, becauſe the ſimilitude, though not altogether exact, yet is not amiſs, nor misbecoming his learning. For the Secular man is, as the Fleſh, ignorant in the waies of the Spirit, and though he were knowing, the power of the Keys is not given to him. Indeed he is not altogether guided as the Fleſh by the Spirit; but ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes muſt not be ſearch'd too near. All this goes well. But why ſo much cacling for this Egg? Balk them not with the crack of learning, and men will croud into this toyl of their own accord. This ſubjection to the Spirit is but in the waies of the Spirit. And all the ſtory in two words of plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is but this, In Spiritual things men are ſubject to the Spiritual power. And who needs St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to tell him that?</p>
                     <p>With all this ado, we are but juſt where we were. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man is indeed ſubject to the Spiritual power in Spirituals; but why is not the Spiritual man ſubject to his power in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals? Becauſe, ſays <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> the Fleſh never governs the Spirit, and the Secular man is as the Fleſh. Yes in Spirituals: but in Temporals He, and He alone has the knowledge. The Spiritual man is as ignorant in them, as he in Spirituals. He too, and He alone has the power. For the ſame hand which gave the Keys to Biſhops, gave t he Sword to Kings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106994:195"/> He is now the Spirit, and the Spiritual man the Fleſh. And ſo the very ſimilitude which was brought for exemption does in truth prove ſubjection.</p>
                     <p>I have been the longer upon this point, becauſe the ſame clew will guide us through all the Labyrinths. Here the Clergy are the Spirit; afterwards, Fathers, and Shepherds, and the Lot of God. And all this is but the ſame ſtuff cut into ſeveral faſhions, which makes not the Web the ſtronger. He ſays then, for a third Argument, that <hi>'tis againſt nature for Children to rule their Parents, or Sheep their Shepherd; and the Clergy are Fathers, and Shepherds.</hi> True; but as they were the Spirit before, in reſpect of Spirituals: in relation to Temporals the Magiſtrate is the Father and Shepherd. And ſo we ordinarily call good Princes the Fathers of their Country,<note place="margin">Iſay 44, &amp; 45.</note> and a Temporal Prince is called by God himſelf his Shepherd, and his Chriſt too. Sure <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will not perſwade many, that a man is a Father and a Paſtor, when he breaks the Laws, and refuſes to contribute to the neceſſities of his Country. To do ſo, is not to feed, and keep the Wolf away, but to ſtarve, and let the Wolf in to devour the Flock. And that we ſhould be obliged to look upon and treat a man as a Father and Paſtor, when he is not ſo, but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whoever may teach, nature does not. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like the former, flies in his face who makes it. We need Spiritual food, and Spiritual direction, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the Spiritual Wolf the Devil. We need alſo Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral food and direction, and ſafety from the Temporal Wolf, the Enemy. The Clergy needs all this as much as other folks: and therefore as they are Fathers and Paſtors, in as much as they ſupply our Spiritual wants: ſo they are Children and Sheep, in as much as they receive Temporal things from others, and ſo by nature obliged to obey their Temporal Fathers and Paſtors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Objects this very thing againſt himſelf, and Anſwers, That a <hi>Prince is indeed a Spiritual Child, and Sheep of the Prieſt, but the Prieſt can in no wiſe be called the Child or Sheep of the Prince.</hi> And that for a very ſtrange reaſon; becauſe <hi>Prieſts and all Clergy-men have a Spiritual Prince of their own, by whom they are governed, not only in Spirituals, but in Temporals too.</hi> But can the Notion of Father and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106994:195"/> be apply'd to that Spiritual Prince in reſpect of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals? Does he provide Temporal Paſtures for the Clergy? Is it from him they have ſafety and quiet when they feed? Does he drive the Wolf away? We ſee with our eyes thoſe things are done by the Temporal Prince; and theſe, and the like, being the things which ground the Notion of Father and Shepherd in Temporals, theſe Notions as evidently belong to the Prince, as the Actions. This which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, is extremely abſurd and intolerably pernicious on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. But I mind not the <hi>Poſition,</hi> but the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Since the Prince breeds and nouriſhes, feeds and ſecures Prieſts, as well as others in the Politick life: it is plain he has in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Notion of Father and Shepherd even to them: and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has no manner of Reaſon to deny they may be called Children and Sheep, and obliged to do what nature teaches Children and Sheep ought to do.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Argument is this, <hi>The Clergy are the Miniſters of God, conſecrated to his ſervice alone, and offered by the whole people for that purpoſe, whence they have their name as belonging to the Lot of God. But the Princes of the World certainly can have no right over thoſe things which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and conſecrated to God, and made as it were his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods.</hi> If I had a mind to Diſpute of Etymologys, or thought it worth while to maintain againſt him, that the Clergy have their name, rather becauſe God is their Lot, than They Gods, there would be enough to take my part. But I love not to loſe time; for which reaſon too I forbear to except againſt all that is exceptionable in the Argument. It will be ſufficient to ſay, that it differs little in ſubſtance from its fellows, only it is ſet forth in another manner. The Service, and Lot of God, are but what he called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Paſtors before. And the ſame Key will ſerve to the Lock. In as much as they are the Lot of God, and in reſpect of his Service, to which they are conſecrated, the Clergy are unaccountable to the Secular Power: but when they deveſt themſelves of the Clergy-man, and wear only the man, that man, if he deſerve to feel the Secular Sword, may, for any thing I ſee in the Argument. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is ſure no part of God's Lot, nor can I imagine how the priviledge of his ſervice ſhould be pretended where there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106994:196"/> is no ſervice of his; nay, where the pretender acts direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to it. Were it true, that Princes had nothing to do with things belonging to God, or men conſecrated to his Service, all Chriſtians, and all things ſeem in a fair way towards Exemptions, as well as Clergy-men. For God has a very true property in all Things, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are all, and that very ſolemnly, conſecrated to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They ſerve him indeed in another way than the Clergy, but they truly ſerve him, and are by ſolemn conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration obliged to that ſervice. Since we ſee that ſervice is ſo far from exempting them from ſubjection to Princes, that obedience to them is part of it, it is plain there is no repugnance betwixt the ſervice of God and ſubjection to Princes, unleſs they command things contrary to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And from ſuch commands all men are exempt as well as the Clergy; with this difference, that the Clergy are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all that is contrary to the ſervice of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the reſt only from what is contrary to the ſervice of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would bear us in hand, that what he ſays is certain, and tells us that <hi>the Light of Reaſon ſhews it, and God has not obſcurely delivered it in the laſt of</hi> Leviticus. <hi>Whatſoever is once conſecrated to God, ſhall be Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys to the Lord.</hi> The Light of Reaſon may indeed do much, when he makes it appear: but He, who is ſo much for Exemptions, ſhould methinks allow us to be exempt from the Ceremonial Law. The Chapter he cites takes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about the offerings made to God, and appoints ſome to be redeemed, others not. But thoſe commands are given to the Jews; we ſee nothing like them in the Chriſtian Law. And no body knows better than himſelf, that we are to be guided by our own, not their Law, and that it lays no obligation on us purely as their Law, though the matter of it do ſometimes bind us on the ſcore of Reaſon. He ſays indeed, that 'tis ſo in this caſe, but barely to ſay ſo is not to prove. His word, if that were the buſineſs, would go far with me; but when he is making Arguments, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an Argument. I ſay no more at preſent, becauſe this I conceive is as much as needs for an Anſwer, and I intend to diſcourſe of the merits of this cauſe more at large hereafter.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106994:196"/>
                     <p>The fifth and laſt Argument <hi>is from ſigns and Prodigys, ſhewn,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>by God on thoſe who have preſumed to violate Eccleſiaſtical Immunities.</hi> For proof of this, he ſends us to one <hi>Bredembachius,</hi> an Author I have never ſeen, and therefore not knowing, nor having means to know particulars, can only anſwer in general. If the ſigns and Prodigys, he talks of, be true Miracles, and thoſe expreſs to the point, clearly wrought in confirmation of Immunities extended as far as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſtretches them, though I am ſlow of belief, yet if it be truly ſo, I will waſh my hands of the buſineſs. God forbid I ſhould doubt of any thing, let it ſeem never ſo ſtrange, and never ſo croſs to my reaſon, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his ſeal to it uncounterfeited. But I am ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there is no ſuch matter. If there were, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is a ſtrange man to amuſe us with his probabilities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary conſequences, when he had proof in ſtore infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more convictive than even demonſtration it ſelf. A Miracle may, perhaps, have been done to ſhew God's care of the Church, or Miniſtry. He is not leſs powerful now than heretofore in his Judgments upon <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abiu, Oza</hi> and <hi>Ozias.</hi> But Miracles are not lightly to be believed, and when they are manifeſt, <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Doctrine may be ne're the truer, unleſs they come home to it. In likelihood, who had <hi>Bredembachius</hi> to ſee what he ſays, would find no more than obſervations of ſignal, perhaps unuſual and unhoped proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities happening to ſome who favoured the Clergy, and croſſes to thoſe who did otherwiſe; which his, whether piety or bigottery enhances into Miracles. If this be all the Fire to the ſmoke, the Topick ill becomes <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s learning. Who had the Malice to collect all that Hiſtory affords of adverſity to the good, and proſperity to the bad, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make as big a Book as that of <hi>Bredembachius.</hi> For 'tis an old complaint, and that of a Wiſe man too, that all things happen alike to the Good and the Bad: as if God had no care of the World, while in truth he has the greater by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things happen ſo, and by that Providence teaching us not to value the Goods of this World, but raiſe our hearts to better. I am the apter to think there is no more in it, becauſe <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf makes a famous buſineſs of what I ſhould not have thought worth alledging. As for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digys
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106994:197"/> and Signs, as many as there be in <hi>Bredembachius,</hi> he had no mind it ſeems to become Voucher ſo much as for one; for he cited not any. But he tells us, the Emperour <hi>Baſilius Porphyrogenitus</hi> laies all the Calamities of that time to the charge of a certain Law made by <hi>Nicephorus Phocas</hi> againſt Eccleſiaſtical Immunity, and ſays that ſince that Law was in force, all things went to wrack. And this he calls a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Teſtimony. As if that Emperour had been made acquainted with the Counſels of God, and ſeen the ſecret ſprings of Providence, which ſet the wheels of Proſperity and Adverſity in motion; or as if worldly Proſperities were to be look'd on by Chriſtians as the reward of vertue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a body would think it went not much better with the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire after that Law than before, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the abrogating that Law, it was finally ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the <hi>Turks.</hi> And now I have mentioned the <hi>Turks,</hi> I remember They Argue ſomething after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when from their ſucceſs They urge, that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of Mahumetiſm againſt Chriſtianity. And with them I leave the Argument, to whom it is a great deal more ſuitable than to Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>So end <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Arguments, and ſo might end my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that, not content with knowing how the waters reliſh, you expect to have the Spring dam'd up. It is a Task which asks a better Workman, and beſides is not the work of a Letter. One half indeed, the claim he makes to the Poſitive Law of God, needs no more trouble: A plain denial is confutation in abundance; for unleſs he could ſhew that Poſitive Law, which he pretends, the pretence is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groundleſs. To unriddle fully the other half, it would be fit to ſearch into the Law of Nature; for how ſhall we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it commands, unleſs we firſt know what it is? Now that is a Queſtion about which men are not agreed, and who would undertake to diſpute it from the beginning, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the pure Oar of Truth from the Droſs of ſeveral mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, would cut out Work for a Volume. That it is nothing but Reaſon is ſufficiently known: but all Laws being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Reaſon, they would all be natural, unleſs their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were ſettled by a more particular account. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> I conceive, does not afford us light enough to ſee our way.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106994:197"/> He puts three degrees: Firſt principles; concluſions evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following; and concluſions not evidently following, but which need human Conſtitution. The two firſt, he ſays, belong properly to the Law of Nature; the third is the Law of Nations, which according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> he diſtinguiſhes from Civil Law, in that the one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from nature, as Concluſions from Premiſes, the other as a determination of Generals to Particulars. As if it be Natural, that who offends be puniſh'd, it is Civil, that he be puniſh'd with this or that puniſhment. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Authority of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf will preſerve even that diſtinction wholly from Queſtion. Poſſibly among Laws confeſſedly Civil, there may be found proper deductions from Reaſon, and among thoſe of Nations, determination of generals to particulars. But whatever be of that matter, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is far enough from vouching what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays. He, as I obſerved before, requires that the Concluſions, which he makes the Law of Nations, be not far removed from their principles. Wherefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s ſecond branch of the Law of Nature is the Law of Nations to him. Of the third branch there is no news in him, nor could he make Law of Nature of it, if there were. He is not a man to take an inevident and unneceſſary concluſion, for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and therefore if he would allow it derived from nature at all, he could allow it only by way of Determination, not of concluſion; that is, for pure Civil, not Law of Nature or Nations. Put it then to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and our Exemptions, which are only the third way derived from Nature, owe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Civil Law, and have no more title to the Law of nature than all Laws; for all are grounded on Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>I am miſtaken as well as you, if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> do not in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſay as much himſelf. For the Law of Nature is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed to be imprinted in us without, and before Conſtitutions: wherefore to make us a Law of Nature which needs human Conſtitution, is to make us a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is not a Law of Nature. Indeed Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is but another word for Civil Law; unleſs you reſtrain Civil Law to one City or Common-wealth. But there is no place for that reſtriction here. If we were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106994:199"/> or not ſubject. It will perhaps be impertinent to add, that this obligation on the one ſide to obey, cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power on the other to command. Nor can there be greater or more palpable non-ſence, than that there ſhould be a Head to order the Members, without power to order them, a Head being nothing but ſuch a power lodg'd in one or more perſons. But 'twill be fit to reflect a little upon this power.</p>
                     <p>As the whole is evidently ſo many men, ſo the power of the Whole is plainly the power of ſo many men. And ſince every man has power over himſelf, and what he has, and the power of every one is transferred to the Head, the Head has plainly power over every man, and what every man has. So that whatever propriety men have by Law in their Goods, or liberty of their actions, 'tis all with ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill to the ſupreme power, which has a greater and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount authority over thoſe very Goods and Actions, and may and ought dipoſe of them as the common good requires. Neither is any thing more reaſonable, nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For 'tis only by conjunction with the whole, and as a part of it, that any man has any thing. That this Land, or Houſe is mine, and not another mans, is only becauſe it is come to me in ſuch a manner as the Laws of that Society whereof I am a Member, have appointed to make it mine. 'Tis only by the ſame conjunction a man can keep what he has. Any one that is ſtronger than he might take it from him, but that the whole in which he lives takes his part, joyned to which he is now ſtronger than the other, and fears him not. Wherefore ſince 'tis the whole which gives and ſecures to every man all he has, the good of the whole is more his good than his private goods can be, and he is wrong'd if when any thing he has is neceſſary for the good of the whole, it be not diſpos'd that way. To grumble at parting with ſomething, when otherwiſe we have nothing, is a pitch of folly at which fordidneſs it ſelf I think is not yet arrived. Again, it cannot, as I ſaid, be otherwiſe. No end can be compaſſed either without means, or with means out of our power. Wherefore to put a Head to look after the good of the Body, without power over the means neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to compaſs that good is manifeſt non-ſence. Theſe means
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106994:199"/> being evidently the Perſons and Things within the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the Head muſt either have power to diſpoſe of both for the good of the whole, or not be a Head.</p>
                     <p>For which reaſon that power cannot be ſeparated from it, no not by the Head it ſelf, much leſs by any body elſe, and 'twould be ill with men if it could. You may as well ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Rational from man; for that is not more eſſential to man, than Power to Head. But were it poſſible, and the Head could ſtrip it ſelf of its power or Headſhip, it might alſo, and muſt by doing ſo, ſtrip the man, whom he puts out of his power, of his Memberſhip. For plainly no Head, no Member. And then, beſides that he would be out of the care of the Head, which is confin'd to the Members, he might at pleaſure or upon fancy, loſe all the benefits he enjoys by being a Member; and thoſe we have found are both the greateſt and all the comforts and aids of life. But I ſpare this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe I think it will return again. In the mean time, we have in a Common-wealth Power in the Head inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and unconfin'd, and which both may and ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all Perſons and Things within the Common-wealth for the common good; and in the Members, obligation to concur to, or obey that diſpoſition, and all this with a neceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo abſolute, that that who takes either away, takes away the Common-wealth too. It remains to look now upon our Exemptions.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe, of which you are Sollicitous, are Exemptions of the Perſons of Clergy-men from the Tribunals, and of their goods from the Taxes of Secular Princes. Peradventure there needs no more to confute both, than to aſſume without more ado, that the Clergy are Members of the Common-wealth. It is a propoſition which one would think needs no proving, and yet the diſpute is at an end, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Members are ſubject; They are Members, therefore they are ſubject, is pretty evident; and that ſubjection goes to the very Notion of Member, is already diſcours'd. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſince <hi>Bellarmin</hi> with an inconſtancy, which ſhews he was at a loſs, ſometimes plainly grants, ſometimes in effect denys it, let us caſt away a little time upon it.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:106994:200"/>
                     <p>The end of a Common-wealth being the good of thoſe who compoſe it, If we ſtop at the goods of this life, a Clergy-man perhaps is no neceſſary Ingredient to a Common-wealth. For Peace and Plenty, quiet and ſecurity, and whatever relates purely to this World, may be had without him. But take a Common-wealth, for a Society deſigning and providing for the whole good of man, and a Clergy-man cannot be ſpared, becauſe on him depends the chief, and in truth the only good of man, <hi>viz.</hi> advancing in the way to Final Bliſs. For other things bear not that name with propriety, farther than as they contribute to this good: on the contrary they are harms when they hinder it, as they alwaies do when they do not advance it. Pleaſure, and Riches, and what the World calls Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as much as our vanity prizes them, are in reality wretched miſeries, when they are lov'd for themſelves, and not uſed for means to better ends; And the Cobler and Beggar is much a happier man, than he that flouriſhes in Coaches, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, if he uſes what God ſends better. A Common-wealth therefore is not perfect, and in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s language, <hi>Nihil extra ſe deſiderans,</hi> nor able to attain the end of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, the good of man, in which there are not means to compaſs This, as well as other Goods. It is the Good for which we are created, the care of which no man can put off, and much leſs a Society of men. This good 'tis plain we cannot have but by the Clergy. It is intruſted to them by God, from whom they received the knowledge of ſaving truths, and command to teach them to the end of the World. Wherefore whatever be of a Common-wealth, conſidered purely with relation to the good of this life, a Chriſtian Common-wealth cannot be without a Clergy-man. A Magiſtrate to end differences, a Souldier to fight, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, an Husbandmn, or who elſe is requiſite for convenience or plenty, may as well and better be ſpared, than he who furniſhes the Common-wealth with a greater and more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary good, and without which the quiet, and ſecurity, and plenty, and whatever others contribute, is uſeleſs. And ſince 'tis evident that They are all Members, and neceſſary Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-wealth, becauſe the end of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth cannot be had without them, 'tis evident alſo the Clergy-man is a neceſſary Member too, and more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106994:200"/> than any of them, becauſe he is a neceſſary means to a more neceſſary part of the end of a Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis tedious to loſe words in a matter determinable almoſt by Eye-ſight. For do we not ſee They make in moſt places one, and the firſt of the three Orders or States, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Body of the Common-wealth? With us indeed They do not make a diſtinct order, but yet They have their place in the Repreſentatives of the Kingdom. Methinks 'tis ſomething an extravagant buſineſs to be put to prove that they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are every where acknowledged for principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Again, Do we not ſee they Inherit, and Purchaſe, and Convey, and do all which men are impowr'd by Birth-right and Memberſhip to do, and to which only Members are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with excluſion of Aliens? In caſe of wrong, do they not draw the waters of relief from the great ſource common to all the Members? And if their Prince deny them Juſtice, do they not think he breaks his Coronation Oath, to render it impartially to all his ſubjects? Do they not claim and receive their ſhare in all the advantages and priviledges of Members, and to which they could have no Title or Pretence if they were not Members? In ſhort, there is no proving any man a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if they be not. For all the Topicks which can be uſed for any, hold for them; nor is it more repugnant to nature, and incompatible with the Notion of a Common-wealth, that a Member is not ſubject to the Head, than it is to common ſence that They are not Members.</p>
                     <p>Lightly then one ſhall not meet with a wilder fancy than that of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s, when he ſays, the Clergy are but materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not formal parts of the Common-wealth, and have a Prince and Tribunals of their own. I doubt, They have no great reaſon to thank him for his ſubtlety. For ſhould they be ſent to that Prince, and thoſe Tribunals for Juſtice as often as they need it (and who but their own Prince is to take care of them?) their complaints perchance might oblige him to think of a ſecond <hi>Recognition.</hi> But yet even ſo much is enough to ſpoil his Market. For bare material living in any Country, ſubjects a mans perſon to the Laws of that Country, and the Goods he has there to Taxes. Aliens are every where protected, while they break not the Laws; but if they do, it will not avail them to plead, they are not formal parts of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106994:201"/> the Common-wealth. They are puniſh'd as natives, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Law of the place in which they are, not their own, appoints. They pay Polls likewiſe, and their ſhare in other Taxes, if they have any thing liable to the Tax. Wherefore though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> went as far as ever he could to find out this <hi>Formally,</hi> and cannot go farther though he would never ſo fain, unleſs he blind folks; (For people who have their eyes can ſee where the Clergy materially live) yet this Formality will do the Clergy no good, the material ſhare which he cannot deny them, drawing along with it a ſhare in puniſhments, when they deſerve it, and Taxes too. And as the Clergy are no way advantaged, the Common-wealth I believe will be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern'd in his ſubtlety. So they can puniſh the perſons, and aſſeſs the goods, I ſuppoſe they will not mind much with what Formalities men of ſpeculation amuſe themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But let us look upon thoſe Exemptions a little nearer. That Common-wealth I conceive is ſickly, and not like to live long, where the members are not protected from injury, and proviſion made for their quiet; But where is no power to do it, there can be no Common-wealth. For a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is the means to procure quiet and ſafety, for which men joyn and continue in Society. It can be no means to procure them, if it have no power to procure them, and ſo ceaſes to be a Common-wealth, and becomes an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unſociated multitude, ſtanding every one on his own guard, and at War with his Neighbour. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be called ſo much as a Heard of a kind of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Beaſts, preying as meer Beaſts, the ſtronger upon the weaker. Now the power of the whole Body being, as has been diſcourſed, in the Head or Prince, the Prince muſt have power to right his ſubjects in caſe of wrong, or there can be neither Head nor Body. Neither is it material from whence the wrong comes. Whoever does it, whether Native or Alien, in or out of his Dominions, become ſubject to his Prince whom he has wrong'd, as far as concerns reparation. Relief is ſought at his hands, and he gives it by forcing the offender to amends, if he be within his reach, or if he be not, 'tis juſt to purſue him where he is, and right his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by War.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106994:201"/>
                     <p>This Reaſon indiſpenſably ſubjects Clergy-men to the power of the Prince, even though they had, according to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s extravagant conceit, another Prince of their own. For 'tis not what they are, or to whom they belong, but what They may do. If they can do wrong, we need not look for more. And that they may do wrong, is ſomething too plain. Whatever Exemptions they claim or have, they have none from the corruption of Nature. 'Twere to be wiſh'd they had. That one Exemption would be more worth than all the reſt. But they may, and alas! do fall ometimes as well as others, and need as well as others the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to awe the crookedneſs of Nature into ſome ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It would ſound harſh, and ſhew perhaps invidious, to dilate this Head into all ſorts of wickedneſs, and ſhew what might be done, and muſt be ſuffered, if there were no help for it. Let it ſuffice that to deny the Prince a power over them, when they happen to break the Laws and fall into crimes, is to abandon private men to all the wrongs, which the Clergy may be tempted to do, and want vertue to reſiſt the Temptation; to abandon the publick to the remedileſs danger of machinations, if at any time they arrive at the height of wickedneſs, Treaſon. In ſhort, 'tis to deny the Prince to be Prince; For he is plainly no Prince who has no power to right his Subjects. By the way, to avoid miſtakes, let me declare once for all, by Prince I mean all along the ſubject of ſupreme power whereſoever lodged, in one or more perſons, according to the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of different Common-wealths. That variety is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, and I will not embroil my ſelf in unconcerning things.</p>
                     <p>It may perhaps be thought that theſe are cauſleſs ſurmizes, and that the goodneſs of Clergy-men is wrong'd by being ſo much as ſuſpected of doing wrong to others, and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at worſt right may upon complaint be had againſt as many as own him, whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> makes their Prince. But I doubt there is more of Bigottery, than ſence in thoſe thoughts. Not that I queſtion the goodneſs of the Clergy. But 'tis not for men to change the ſecurity of relief, when they need it, which they have from their Head as Members, into a faint, and poſſibly deceitful confidence of a private mans vertue.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106994:202"/> And then to ſeek relief from any but ones own Prince, to omit that 'tis unpracticable, and has a hundred inſuperable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences beſides, 'tis plainly againſt the nature and end of a Common-wealth. For men live united to obtain redreſs of wrongs by their union, and would quickly break it, if they be forc'd to ſeek it elſewhere, and where the very purſuit of it may chance prove as great a wrong, as that whereof they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue redreſs.</p>
                     <p>As theſe things are too plain to be a ſecret any where, they are underſtood in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, and when time was, were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pleaded. 'Twas urged in behalf of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in their conteſts about this matter with <hi>Paul</hi> V,<note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſup. Cenſ. Stiſ. ſuae. P P. <hi>Pauli V.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>That the power of puniſhing offences againſt the Laws, could not be ſeparated from the ſupreme Power, and that to ſay a Prince had any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Dominions not ſubject to him in Temporal matters, or any other concerning the publick good, was all one as to ſay he was not Prince.</hi> To make which diſcourſe the more ſtriking They brought it to his own door, and alledged, <hi>That the Pope exempted indeed from Biſhops and Archbiſhops, but could not exempt from himſelf without ceaſing to be Pope.</hi> They urged alſo, what peradventure is more ſenſible in a Country ſo impatient of injuries, but yet ruinous every where; That the Laity being wrong'd by the Clergy, and not revenged by the Magiſtrate, will revenge themſelves; and which is worſe, out of deſpair of being righted when they are once wronged, ſtudy to be before-hand, and prevent the wrongs they fear. Which what a gate it ſets open to the diſturbance and ruine of the Common-wealth, is needleſs to be mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I have not been ſollicitous particularly of the Exemption from Taxes claim'd by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> becauſe I think it will not be hard to get his conſent, that the Goods of the Clergy go along with their Perſons. Nevertheleſs we may briefly reflect, which I think was hinted before, that the Prince, or ſupreme power is to provide for the ſecurity of the whole; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion cannot be made without means; that theſe means being in the hands of particulars, unleſs they may be taken out of thoſe hands, to be employ'd for the publick good, as occaſion requires, no proviſion can be made, and the end of Society is loſt. And ſince the Clergy have their ſhare, oftentimes a very large one, in the goods of the Common-wealth, as they can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106994:202"/> hardly be ſpared at any time without envy of the reſt, and grumbling at the inequality of publick burthens, ſo the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence may be ſuch that They cannot be ſpared at all. For it may require the utmoſt of what the Common-wealth can do, and all be little enough. However That what They have may be neceſſary to the end of the Common-wealth, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjects what They have to the power of the Common-wealth. And this a better Maſter than <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> has long ſince taught us in few, but very ſignificant words: <hi>If Thou wilt not be ſubject</hi> (obnoxius) <hi>to Caeſar, have no things of the World; but if thou haſt Riches, Thou art ſubject to Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Conſiderations are but a few of many which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject affords. Who would diſſect the Notion of Common-wealth into all the parts which neceſſarily, and indiſpenſably concur to the whole frame, would never have done. There is enough ſaid for a Letter, and what is ſaid I think is very clear.</p>
                     <p>'Tis plain the World, which was made for the uſe of man, cannot be uſed to any tolerable convenience of life, without thoſe Societies, which are called Common-wealths. 'Tis plain, a Common-wealth cannot be without a Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor they without power to command, and obligation to obey, for the end of the Common-wealth. 'Tis plain, the Clergy are Members, at leaſt in a Chriſtian Common-wealth, and though they were not, would be nere a whit the leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Power under which they live, barely by living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. For which, though I contented my ſelf with alledging the cuſtom of Nations, yet who will may find it in Nature too. As a ſtranger cannot go into a Foreign Country with ſafety, unleſs the Laws there ſecure him from injury, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that Country receive him with ſafety, unleſs the ſame Laws may hinder him from doing any. Again, thoſe Laws are Rules appointed for the common good, and if the Stranger do not regulate his Actions, and Traffick, and whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce he has with the Natives, by thoſe Rules, the common good is prejudic'd, and the Power to whoſe care it belongs, is to procure reparation from the Stanger. So that who Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, does upon the matter leave, or rather ſuſpend his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip with the community to which Birth ſubjects him, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106994:203"/> for the time of his ſtay unites himſelf to that in which he is, whereof he becomes a kind of Member, with that difference betwixt him and proper Members, which his caſe requires, and the Laws whether of Nations, or particular Countrys have eſtabliſh'd. 'Tis farther plain, that Security, and Quiet, are ſome of the many goods for which men live united in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Tis plain, they cannot be attained, without power to hinder diſquiet, and wrong; and that Power is plainly no Power, if it cannot act where-ever 'tis needful it ſhould for thoſe ends. Wherefore whoever brings diſturbance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury into the Common-wealth, muſt of neceſſity come under the Power which is to keep them out. I might have dilated farther; but I thought it ſuperfluous, conceiving he muſt be very partial, or rather very blind, who needs more light to diſcover <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Exemptions, not only groundleſs and unproved, but unprovable, and manifeſtly inconſiſtent with the great and moſt natural good of man, regulated Society. Wherefore 'tis as impoſſible they ſhould be commanded by God, or Nature, as that either can command things harmful to man, or incompatible one with another. Neither can he, who will obſtinately perſiſt to maintain they are, avoid being driven at laſt to ſay, That Bad proceeds from the Author of Good.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem ſtrange that Learned and Good men ſhould be for things ſo falſe, and ſo pernicious. But whither will not miſtaken Zeal tranſport us? It ſhew'd them, I ſuppoſe, but one ſide of the Meddal, and made them ſo hot upon the advantage of the Church, and Church-men, that they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the harm they did the Common wealth. Which is the leſs to be wondred at, becauſe it hindred them from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that They hurt even thoſe they think to pleaſure. For I am much miſtaken if theſe Exemptions be not more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Clergy themſelves, then any body elſe. And this not only for the dependence the Church has on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, without which it cannot well be, but on nearer and more obvious conſiderations. Let a King ſay to a Clergy-man, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would have him, <hi>I have no power over you,</hi> He ſays at the ſame time, <hi>I am no Head in reſpect of you, nor you a Member in reſpect of me, or of that Body whereof I am Head.</hi> Thus much even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf ſays; for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106994:203"/>
'tis his diſtinction of material and formal Members, in other words; though I know he elſewhere ſpeaks otherwiſe. Now This, if I underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is to ſay, <hi>If any body wrong you, you muſt not come to me for redreſs; for I have nothing to do with you. Or if good nature make me interpoſe, 'tis purely out of Charity; not Juſtice and the obligation a Head has to the Members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pray how far is this from Out-lawry? An Out-law is but one put out of the King's protection: and he who cannot claim his protection of right, ſeems not much, if at all, better than he who is formally put out of it. For a King may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect an Out-law if he pleaſe; and unleſs he pleaſe, at this rate he need not protect a Clergy-man. However barely to change the priviledge a ſubject has to ſay to his Prince, <hi>I beſeech you do me Juſtice,</hi> into <hi>I beſeech you do me a kindneſs,</hi> is what the Clergy are ſtrange men if they take for a Priviledge, and they are ſtranger friends to them who will not be quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>Again, will not the caſe be altered, if thoſe among whom They live, ceaſe to look upon them as fellow Members, and whoſe good, for the community of Society, is their own? The experience of ſtrangers in all Nations, inſtructs us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently how coldly people intereſt themſelves in their wants, or afflictions, or whatever concerns. And what more than ſtrangers are They, who by ceaſing to be under the Princes power, ceaſe to be parts of the Common-wealth? ſave mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> phraſes it, and ſo are ſtrangers. Till the World be made up of courteſie, and good Nature, and every body be ſure to be their friend, whether he be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged or no, the Clergy in my opinion ſhould for their own ſakes ceaſe even to wiſh for ſuch Exemptions. As men are now, 'twill be ill for them to have nothing but good Nature, and Courteſie to truſt to.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, as the Clergy are of the ſame nature with other men, they need the ſame conveniences and ſupports of life; nor did thoſe, who invented theſe Exemptions, mean, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to diminiſh thoſe conveniences and thoſe ſupports. Other men ſeek and find ſuch things in Society: Can the Clergy hope for them otherwiſe? Can they get what they want, or keep what they get, or recover what they loſe, but by means of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106994:204"/> the Common-wealth? It is plain, their caſe is the ſame with other men in this point. Whatever They enjoy, They hold by Common-wealth Tenure, and cannot poſſibly hold other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now I ask not how they can pretend from the Common-wealth, if they be not of the Common-wealth, nor any of the many obvious queſtions which the matter ſuggeſts, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are partly hinted before. I mind only the Priviledge, and would know what Priviledge, Exemption from Taxes is, ſave a Priviledge of doing ones ſelf a miſchief. A man has a Penny: if he part with one-Farthing, he ſaves three; if he do not, he loſes all four. Is it a Priviledge to this man, to keep his Farthing, when it is plainly to keep nothing? So it is with the Common-wealth, to which if we contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we can keep nothing. It preſerves us all we have, and our contributions preſerve it. It is the great Ship, which carries us ſafe through a Sea of miſeries, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſwallow us up. Who deſires to be exempted from pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and labouring in it, when it is needful, what priviledge does he deſire, but the priviledge of drowning? It is plain, that the good of the whole is every private mans good, and more than any private good can be; for by it he has all other goods. It is plain, that Taxes are neceſſary to this good. Wherefore it is alſo plain, that a Priviledge of not concurring to Taxes, is but a Priviledge of not concurring to a mans own good, and his greateſt good; a Priviledge of letting the Common-wealth periſh, and periſhing with it for company. Clergy-men muſt of neceſſity ſtand and fall with it, as well as others, even though they were but material parts of it, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> fancys. When the Ship Sinks, the Paſſenger is loſt as well as the Marriner.</p>
                     <p>I cannot imagine how This ſhould be thought a Priviledge unleſs by that error, which has ruined many a Common-wealth, of thinking all loſt which is given to the Publick. Did people reflect, that what is given in that manner, is inſtead of being loſt, put out to Intereſt for them, and to a greater advantage than they can poſſibly make themſelves, They would change their thoughts and language. The true priviledge lies on the other ſide, that by means of Society, what particular men have ſhall be employed more for their good, and in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manner, than themſelves can employ it; and that, when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106994:204"/> they have not wit enough to prefer a greater good before a leſs, there are who will take what they are reſty to give, and do them good whether they will or no. Next to the Priviledge of Nature, ability to purſue our own good our ſelves, is the Priviledge of Fortune, to fall into hands which will do it for us. In ſhort, ſince Man is a Creature made and obliged to ſeek his own good, and the great good of man is Society, and the good of that Society, the great good of every particular in it, and Taxes are for the good of that Society, to deſire to be exempted from Taxes and think it a Priviledge, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be exempted from acting according to our Nature, and think that a Priviledge which is a miſery. For a man who acts not like a man, is a very wretched, and a very contemptible thing.</p>
                     <p>I deſire not to be miſtaken, as if I thought a Common-wealth muſt needs be ruin'd, as often as a private man fails in his <hi>Quota,</hi> or that ſome, and as many as the Publick pleaſes, may not be exempted from Taxes. On the contrary, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not only ſafe, but even fit to exempt thoſe who have no more than can be ſpared from the neceſſities of the Common-wealth without prejudice, or employ what they have to as great, perhaps a greater advantage than Taxes. For the Common-wealth both needs it not for the end of Taxes, and enjoys the benefit of it in another, and it may be better way. And ſuch at leaſt ſhould be the caſe of the Clergy, of which I intend to ſay ſomething before I have done. I meant only to ſay, that not to concur to Taxes is in its nature ruinous to the Publick, and therefore no Priviledge, but a harm to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers, who if the Common-wealth periſh, muſt needs periſh with it. And that it's in its nature ruinous is evident. For let every man refuſe, the Common-wealth cannot ſtand. That this effect does not follow, when private men are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, or exempt themſelves by fraud, happens not for want of harm in the thing, but becauſe a ſingle man has no ſenſible proportion to the whole, and ſo the good or harm he does is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible. Now if there were but one, or a few Clergy-men in a Nation, or but one or a few Fields in their poſſeſſion, as Little in moral things paſſes for nothing, They would not need to pretend Natural or Divine Law for Exemptions. Every body would be more forward to give to, than take from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106994:205"/> them. But where They have a conſiderable part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Common-wealth in their hands, as in ſome places of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territory <hi>P. Paulo</hi> ſays, they have a fourth, in ſome a third part, the Common-wealth can hardly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without their aſſiſtance. For beſides that the reſt would alwaies grumble at the inequality of publick burthens, They would not often bear them with any tolerable conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where ſo much more than their ſhare is laid on their ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>I forbear to weave the Exemption from Juſtice into the ſame diſcourſe, becauſe every body I ſuppoſe will do it of himſelf. For every body muſt ſee that Juſtice is as great, and as indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable a good as Taxes, as neceſſary to the whole, and to Particulars; and therefore that the Priviledge of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it, is but a priviledge of doing the Common-wealth as much harm, as depends on the Exemptee, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ruine That with which he muſt needs be ruined too.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole I conceive I may with confidence conclude that theſe Exemptions, as being many ways harmful cannot proceed from God or Nature, and therefore what the Clergy have of this kind, They have from human Power, ſeeing, and by their wiſdom providing, that what harm there is in their Nature, be over-ballanc'd by a greater good. And in this perſwaſion I conceive too I ſhall be well abetted. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture where things are clear by Reaſon, more light is as needleſs, as Torches to ſee at Noon. But the pallate of the Age is queaſie. Men refuſe good meat ſometimes, becauſe they fancy not the diſhes, and will not harken to Truth but from a mouth they like. To gratifie their humours, it will be neceſſary to take a little more pains, and produce Vouchers of greater credit.</p>
                     <p>As for grave Authors of his own Form, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted me from the trouble of looking after them. For he brings them to the Bar himſelf, and opens their Evidence, and ſtrives to anſwer it.</p>
                     <p>I thought once to have Reply'd to his Anſwers. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that my Pitcher, contrary to the caſe in <hi>Horace,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready become a Jarr, and 'twould be monſtrous to work it into a Tun, I conſidered it is not our buſineſs at preſent. We are not now upon the <hi>What's ſaid,</hi> but the <hi>Who ſaid it.</hi> To exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106994:205"/> who has moſt reaſon for what he ſays, is to turn back to the merits of the Cauſe, which if any one will do, I am well content to leave him to himſelf. For he muſt have either very bad eyes, or much turn'd away, who will not eaſily ſee through all that is ſaid. In the mean time it is enough for my purpoſe that 'tis acknowledged, and by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, that what he ſays is contradicted by Catholicks, men of note as well as himſelf, and whoſe <hi>No</hi> has as much authority as his <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I conceive it fitting to produce ſome of a higher Form, and whoſe credit is unqueſtionable. To begin with one, againſt whom none can ſpeak, or be heard without impiety, I vouch in the firſt place St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Let every Soul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher Powers.</hi> And here I might end as well as begin: For this is in truth alone deciſive. He muſt have no Soul who can pretend this command comprehends him not. Yet let us hear his Interpreters. <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon this place has theſe words, <hi>Sive eſt Sacerdos, &amp;c. whether one be a Prieſt, or Prelate, or have profeſt a Monaſtical life, let him obey thoſe</hi> (ijs cedat) <hi>to whom Magiſtracy is committed. Theophylact,</hi> upon the ſame place, has almoſt the ſame words; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſos erudit, &amp;c. He inſtructs All, whether a Prieſt, or Monk, or Apoſtle, that they be ſubject to Princes.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Hom.</hi> 23. upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Sed eas Paulus, &amp;c. But</hi> Paul <hi>makes uſe of ſuch reaſons as command obedience to the Powers by way of debt; ſhewing thoſe things are commanded All, as well Prieſts as Monks, not Seculars only. And this he declares in the very beginning, when he ſays,</hi> Let every Soul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher Powers: <hi>Though you be an Apoſtle, though an Evangeliſt, though a Prophet; in fine, whatſoever you be. For this ſubjection is not againſt Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us next hear Popes themſelves, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> writing to the Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> tells him, that <hi>The Prelates of the Church owe him all obedience in Temporals:</hi> And again, Ep. 10. <hi>Antiſtites Religionis, Biſhops alſo themſelves are to obey thy Laws,</hi> and this becauſe, <hi>foraſmuch as concerns the Order of Publick Diſcipline,</hi> that is, the Government of the Common-wealth, <hi>We know the power is by ſupernal diſpoſition, given to Thee. Anaſtaſius</hi> to the ſame Emperour acknowledges, that <hi>Biſhops are ſubject to the Laws of the Prince in what concerns pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106994:206"/> Diſcipline: But Princes to Biſhops in diſpenſing the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Sacraments. Pelagius</hi> the firſt, <hi>Ep.</hi> 16. to <hi>Childebert</hi> King of <hi>France. With how much ſtudy and labour muſt we endeavour, for taking away the ſcandal of ſuſpicion, to offer the duty of our confeſſion to Kings, to whom the Holy Scriptures command us alſo to be ſubject.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ſpeaks with a ſubmiſſion which offends <hi>Baronius,</hi> and makes him ſtrain his wits to find a ſcurvy way to colour the buſineſs. But no Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh will ly. That <hi>he was ſubject to</hi> the Emperours <hi>command:</hi> That he did <hi>what he ought in obeying the Emperour</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>ſpeaking for God</hi> on the other: <hi>That Power from Heaven is given to the Piety of his Lords,</hi> as he calls Emperours, <hi>over all men, over Prieſts as well as Souldiers,</hi> &amp;c. have a blunt ill natur'd clearneſs, which no Art can practice upon.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but take notice by the way how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſtrives to weather thoſe Rocks. He objects againſt himſelf the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with the other to the ſame purpoſe out of St. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and what St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays of the matter: And anſwers, <hi>That thoſe places are general, and mean no more than that every one be ſubject to his own Superiour. But the ſubjection of the Clergy to Princes cannot be proved by them, till it be proved that Princes are lawful, Superiours and Judges of the Clergy, which cannot be proved, unleſs it be proved that Sheep have preheminence over Paſtors, Children over Parents, and Temporals over Spirituals. And yet we do not contradict St.</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>neither. For though we ſay the Pope alone is the proper Judge of the Clergy, and Monks, yet we confeſs the King is King</hi> of them as well as the Laity. For Princes fight for them, and They muſt honour and pray for him, and obey him too, directively not co-actively, and with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſtrictions.</p>
                     <p>That Prejudice ſhould be thus powerful! Is it poſſible <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> ſhould in earneſt perſwade himſelf, the Apoſtles meant only in general, that every one ſhould obey whom he ought obey, the Laity their Secular, the Clergy their Eccleſiaſtical Superiour? Are not the Superiours, or higher Powers, whom <hi>All</hi> are commanded to obey, expreſly named by St. <hi>Peter, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Dukes,</hi> or <hi>Governours,</hi> ſent to puniſh evil doers; and by St. <hi>Paul, Magiſtrates</hi> who bear the Sword? Can he think this Command is comply'd with by obedience to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106994:206"/> Superiours? Are They Kings? Do they bear the Sword? Are They the Miniſters of God to wrath, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? What better proof would he have, the Kings are lawful Superiours, even of the Clergy, than St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives, <hi>viz.</hi> that their powers are ordained by God, whom to reſiſt is to acquire Damnation?</p>
                     <p>In St. <hi>Peter</hi> we find the reaſon of his Doctrine expreſt, when he admoniſhes Chriſtians ſo to converſe among the Gentiles, that They who ſpeak ill of them, may be moved by their good Works to glorifie God, and the ignorance of the fooliſh be ſilenc'd. By the Calumny which the Apoſtle means, all Interpreters underſtand a ſuſpicion crept in among the Gentiles of diſobedience to Temporal powers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Laws. For ſuch a ſeditious Doctrine there was among the Jews, begun by <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Galilean,</hi> and tenaciouſly embrac'd by the Phariſees. It was too well known by the diſorders it cauſed, and being miſtaken for a point of the Jews Religion, Chriſtians were aſperſt with it as deriving their Religion from them. Both the Apoſtles took care to clear Chriſtianity from the aſperſion, and therefore inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Faithful to obey Secular powers, not by conſtraint or force, <hi>Propter Iram,</hi> as they phraſe it, but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe ſuch was the Will of God, who had given them the power they had.</p>
                     <p>This was the matter of Fact. Conſider now how <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> handles it. There is indeed, ſaith he, expreſs mention made of Kings, becauſe at that time it was very neceſſary, leaſt they ſhould have hindred the Preaching of the Goſpel, but yet the Apoſtles meant no more, than that every one ſhould be ſubject to his own lawful Superiour.</p>
                     <p>Is not this to ſay, that the Apoſtles were not men of that holy ſimplicity, which is believed? For 'tis plainly to go about to over-reach Princes with fair words: to ſeek, by making them believe They ſhould have obedience from All, to cajole them into the Church, there to be taught a new leſſon, and find there was no ſuch matter. Is it not to ſay, They did not diſpence the Goſpel with that Fidelity which they profeſs? For they included every one within the command of obedience, and yet meant a good part ſhould not be included. They taught that Kings and Magiſtrates were Higher powers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106994:207"/> of all, and that it is the Will of God, that all be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, and know for all that it is not the Will of God, and that They are not higher Powers in reſpect of the Clergy. In ſhort, it is to make them ſpeak plain non-ſence. For if this Comment paſs, their diſcourſe will be this: People have no reaſon to think any Chriſtian diſobedient to Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, For we tell you ſome muſt obey it, and the reſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</p>
                     <p>Then for St <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> he contradicts not him, he ſays, The Saint ſays, That All, the Clergy as well as the reſt, and the higheſt degrees of them, are ſubject to thoſe Higher Powers of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, Princes can med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle neither with their Perſons, nor Goods. Is not this to ſay, They are not ſubject? and is not <hi>ſubject,</hi> and <hi>not-ſubject,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? How can he avoid contradicting St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and the reſt, who ſpeak as he does? Why, though he make the Pope alone the proper Judge, yet he allows the Prince to be King of the Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is this but a new contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? For how can a King be a King, and not a proper Judge? To determine differences is one, and an eſſential part of a Kings Office! 'Tis true, between a Judge by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a King, there is a difference. And yet even ſuch a one repreſents the King. But to be a proper Judge, without Commiſſion, by an inherent right of his own, is inſeparable from a King. The truth is, 'tis all contradiction from firſt to laſt. Secular Princes are not lawful Superiours, and yet Kings of the Clergy, is contradiction: They have Kingly, that is, Supreme Power, and yet the Eccleſiaſtical is to be obeyed in caſe of contrary commands, is contradiction: They are Kings in reſpect of thoſe who are not Subjects, nor formally parts of the Common-wealth, is contradiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s fault. He has but one; fixing on the wrong ſide: which whoever does, let him be never ſo learned, can no more avoid contradiction, than He can falling, let him be never ſo dextrous, under whom the ground founders.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our Road, People may ſpeculate themſelves out of Common ſence, if they will, and do, more often than every body thinks. The truth is, whoever takes a wrong Principle, and will purſue it, muſt come thither at laſt. Yet though he may ſo diſguiſe the matter with learned ſubtilties,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106994:207"/> that he perceive not where he is himſelf, Nature will be too ſtrong for Artifice, and ſhew it ſelf through all diſguiſes. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have been made againſt the poſſibility of Motion, and whiteneſs of Snow: but the World could never be perſwaded they could not go about their buſineſs, or that Snow look'd like Jet. We have found the point in queſtion rooted in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cultivated by the great Labourers in the field of Grace, the Apoſtles. Either way it muſt needs grow, and appear in the hearts whether of men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Faithful. And ſo it evidently does. Let a man go to a Biſhop or Prieſt in any Country of Chriſtendom, and ask him ſeriouſly, <hi>Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Common-wealth in which you live? Are you a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Prince?</hi> He would not be thought well in his wits. Such they own ſuch they call and write themſelves, for ſuch the Prince, and People, and every body takes them, nor is it more known that there are Clergy very where, than that where-ever they are, They are Subjects of the Prince of the place, both in the eſteem of all beſides, and their own conſtant profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Take for a curioſity, (For the clearneſs of the thing does not endure proof) the Oath which the Biſhops in <hi>France</hi> make to their King. <hi>I ſwear and promiſe to your Majeſty, Sire, that as long &amp; I live I will be to you a Faithful Subject and Servant; that with all my power I will procure the good of your Service and Eſtate; that I will never be preſent at any Council or Aſſembly held to the prejudice of them, and that if any thing come to my knowledge, I will preſently give advice to your Majeſty. So help me God and his Holy Goſpels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſo palpable a Truth, that <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as it is to his Doctrine, cannot but acknowledge it. For this reaſon he is forc'd to confeſs, that Kings are Kings in reſpect of the Clergy as well as Laity; that the Clergy, beſides their Spiritual capacity, are alſo parts of the Common-wealth; and in that quality oblig'd to obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the light of Nature, however it may be obſcured in particulars, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put out generally, and we for our parts, you know, think as much of what is written in our hearts by the Apoſtles. But to let that paſs, This is in truth the whole buſineſs. To your Queſtion, whether the Clergy are Subjects or no, all Chriſtendom anſwers they are. Now 'tis evident that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106994:208"/> remaining Subjects can have nothing inconſiſtent with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: And 'tis as evident, that the Exemptions in queſtion, in the latitude in which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> propoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, are inconſiſtent with ſubjection. 'Tis therefore evident. They belong not to the Clergy by Divine, or any Right. Neither can thoſe, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch they have, be Exemptions from ſubjection, but in the manner of ſubjection, as Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges put a difference between Subjects, requiring either dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent duties, or the ſame duties in a different manner, from ſome and others. And ſince the difference betwixt them and the Laity, as to ſubjection, is not from their ſtate, and where the Laws put no difference, all are alike ſubject, there can be no Title nor Pretence to the difference which is, but from the Laws, and the pleaſure of the Power which made them.</p>
                     <p>What Reaſon tells us muſt be, unqueſtionable Records aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us actually was. For the Laws are ſtill extant among the reſt, which make up the Body of the Civil Law, by which the Clergy obtained now one, now another Priviledge, till the whole number was compleated by many Emperours, and in a long time. I had once reſolved to ſet them down; but my Letter being long, and that Book common, I thought it not convenient to increaſe it, with copying what, who has the curioſity may as well ſee in the Original. Beſides, that our Country not being ſubject to the Imperial Laws, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Clergy here are to be regulated, not by them, but our own. Yet 'tis not amiſs to ſet what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays to them. He objects them againſt himſelf, as a proof that the Clergy heretofore were of Right ſubject to Emperours: and anſwers that the Emperours ſometimes meddle with what they have nothing to do: and therefore thoſe Laws muſt needs be ſaid to proceed <hi>De Facto,</hi> not <hi>De Jure,</hi> and to have been tolerated ſometimes, but never approved by Popes.</p>
                     <p>This to my ear ſounds very ſtrangely. What has the Popes approbation to do with the Laws of Emperours? Cannot They make Laws without asking him leave? Cannot They do ſo much as a kindneſs to the Clergy, but by authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him? Again, if his approbation were of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how could it appear more plainly than in that which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls his Toleration, in taking advantage of them, and taking care they ſhould be every where kept, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106994:208"/> Clergy enjoy what They had by them? Of which there are inſtances enough to be produced, if there were need. For I cannot think that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is of opinion in earneſt, that the Pope did not like them, and was not heartily glad of them too. On the contrary I am apt to believe, that had the World remained in the ſame ſtate, in which it was when thoſe Laws were made, ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, He lik'd them ſo well, that he would never have look'd for more, nor we heard any news of Divine Right. But the ſtate of things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and municipal Laws prevailing over thoſe Laws, in a great part of Chriſtendom, it became neceſſary to preſerve thoſe priviledges, to find out a Title to them which might do what thoſe Laws no longer could, carry them through every where. Divine Right peradventure had otherwiſe never been thought of.</p>
                     <p>But to let this paſs, to ſay the Laws proceeded not <hi>de Jure,</hi> or were unjuſt, has ſo preſumptuous a found, that he had need be very ſure of what he ſays, who ventures to ſay it. Now <hi>Bellarmin</hi> when he was upon the point, and had undertaken the proof of Divine Right, could find nothing beyond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable even to himſelf. But becauſe Probability makes a man ſure of nothing, I doubt he was ſomething too bold with Emperours and their Laws, to Tax them of Injuſtice. For if they have any, it is more than he knows, even by his own confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But let us conſider a little, and ask whether the Clergy of thoſe times, when thoſe Laws were made, did know that without and independently of them, They had right to the ſame priviledges by other Laws, thoſe of God and Nature? If they did not, They were manifeſtly ignorant in a point of Gods Law (if it be as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays Gods Law.) Who can imagine this of thoſe Lights, the greateſt, ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days, that ever ſhined in the Church? And how comes <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to know that of which they were ignorant? If they did, They were manifeſtly deficient in their duty. For they ought to have inſtructed the Emperours in this point of Gods Law as well as the reſt; otherwiſe They were unfaithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the Word, and ſubtracted part of what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to them.</p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106994:209"/>
                     <p>That They did not teach the Emperours any ſuch Doctrine, is plain, becauſe the Emperours learnt it not, who yet learned all Chriſtianity from them, and muſt have learnt this if it had been any part of the Leſſon. I hope it will not be put off upon their reſtineſs, to admit a point derogatory to their Authority: Beſides, that this conceit traduces Chriſtianity, with holding Doctrines derogatory to the Authority of Princes, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that calumny of the Pagans, which the Apoſtles were ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to take away, 'tis an aſperſion unſufferably injurious to the piety of thoſe Emperours, and manifeſtly impoſſible beſides.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe Exemptions were not granted all at one time, or by one Emperour. Between the firſt grant by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the laſt in the Law, there intervened ſeveral hundreds of years. During this time theſe Priviledges (for ſo they are expreſly termed) came forth, now one, now another; as the piety of the Prince, the ſollicitation of the Clergy, and reaſon of the thing, prevailed. Can it be imagined among ſo many Emperours, all Chriſtian, there was no one of vertue enough to admit a Right eſtabliſh'd by God, and who favoured the Clergy enough not to keep from them what was their due? Were there but one ſuch in all the number, as it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd but that there were many, and He made ſenſible that the Law of God was as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, of which it was both the duty and duty and intereſt of the Clergy to make him ſenſible, the buſineſs could not poſſibly paſs as it did. For he would certainly have acknowledged this Right of theirs, and inſtead of ſo many grants one after another, once for all confirm'd that right by his Authority, and this with reference to the Law of God, and as their right, not by way of Priviledge, as the ſtile of their Laws runs. 'Tis therefore as plain as can be, that the Clergy, who were as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays <hi>de Facto</hi> ſubject, thought they ought to be ſubject; 'Tis plain the Emperours thought ſo too, and were not otherwiſe inſtructed by the Maſters of Chriſtianity in thoſe times. Wherefore 'tis plain, the ſence of the Chriſtian World then, was quite different from what is <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s now, and I think there needs ſomething more than unconcluding Arguments to perſwade a man, that the whole Chriſtian World was in an Error.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106994:209"/>
                     <p>As for the quarrel he has to the Laws for diſpoſing of things plainly Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual, I know not what to ſay to it, unleſs he would explain himſelf a little more. Princes I think may make Laws in matters, plainly Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual, without asking <hi>Bellarmin</hi> leave, or giving him cauſe of offence. When they enact Reverence to be born the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Tithes to be paid them, the Chriſtian Law they teach to be obſerved, and a hundred things more, He does not ſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve They do the Clergy wrong, or exceed their own bounds. In general, let a thing be never ſo Spiritual, and never ſo much commanded by God, if you will have the Tranſgreſſors aw'd by the fear of Temporal puniſhment, the concurrence of Temporal Authority is neceſſary to engage the Temporal Sword. Otherwiſe who is wicked enough to ſlight the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ſtand out an Excommunication, may break all the Laws of God at pleaſure. Wherefore this Exception to the Juſtneſs of a Temporal Law, That it meddles with a matter plainly Spiritual, is plainly no juſt exception. What <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> means by it, we ſhall know when he tells us what his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is. And yet though it were true, that thoſe Princes had ſometimes paſt their bounds, it is nothing to purpoſe unleſs it be proved, They did ſo in this particular. To take firſt for granted, that Princes did amiſs elſewhere, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire we ſhould therefore believe They did amiſs here too, is to impoſe upon us a little too groſly.</p>
                     <p>After all, as learned a ſhew as he makes of confuting ſome body, we think all parties are agreed. <hi>The Clergy were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubject, and this appears by the Laws,</hi> ſays the objection. By the way, this can mean nothing but that, as to the matters indulged them by Priviledges, They were ſubject in the ſame manner as the Laity, till thoſe priviledges put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Otherwiſe that notwithſtanding their priviledges They always were, and ſtill are, truly ſubjects, is the ſence of all the World. To this, what ſays <hi>Bellarmin? That thoſe Laws proceeded</hi> de Facto, <hi>not</hi> de Jure. This is to ſay, that <hi>de Facto</hi> They were ſubject as well as the Laity heretofore, and that this appears by theſe Laws which proceeded <hi>de Facto,</hi> to favour them in ſome things. And this is the very thing which the objection ſays. That they did not proceed <hi>de Jure,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be allowed to ſay, becauſe he would otherwiſe have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106994:210"/> nothing to ſay; but reaſon will not allow any man to believe him, unleſs he could prove it, which when he went about to do, we ſee how ill he ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I ſee theſe priviledges were granted at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and long diſtant times. I ſee that the Clergy when they had the former, had not the later, and before They had the firſt, had none at all. Wherefore I muſt needs think that as They were <hi>de Facto</hi> ſubject before the Laws, ſo they would be <hi>de Facto</hi> ſtill but for the Laws. This way They have a clear undoubted right to their priviledges, as much and as ſtrong as any body has to any worldly thing. No other Right was ever thought of in thoſe Ages; and yet in thoſe Ages lived all the Doctors of the Church both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> men who had at leaſt as much inſight into the Laws of God and Nature as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and as much Zeal for the good and honour of the Church. He does not make out ſo much as plauſibly the Right which he pretends from thoſe Laws. I conceive therefore I may conclude upon the whole, the Exemptions, or priviledges which the Clergy have, are all from Human, not Divine Law, which though it alwaies guided the Church, and was perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture better underſtood, and more reverenc'd in former times, was never pretended till lately: That They neither have nor can have any Exemptions, which free them abſolutely from ſubjection, that being a thing which neither a Prince can grant, nor Nature bear: And that whatever <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, this is acknowledg'd both by the Clergy themſelves, and all the World beſides, by the univerſal conſent of all people and places that notwithſtanding all their Exemptions, They are ſtill truly Subjects, and by being ſo obliged to all that ſubjection obliges, with that difference betwixt them and others in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their ſubjection, which their priviledges import. Poſſibly out of this univerſality may be excepted ſome of thoſe who live as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> did, in the Popes Territories, and ſo have but one Prince both in Spirituals and Temporals. Theſe are too apt to think it is, or ought to be, with the reſt of the World as it is with them; And who knows whether that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit be not the original ſource of the whole ſtream? But elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I think the General Rule has no exception.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I had done, but that I remember we live in times, in which notice is publickly taken of the contempt of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106994:210"/> Clergy, and Reaſons given for it. They indeed miſs the mark, nor do I think it fit to give the true ones. But I would not have the bad humour of the Age fed by any thing of mine. As <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has gone too far on the one ſide, ill will may go much farther on the other, and poſſibly take occaſion from what I have ſaid againſt him to do ſo. I conceive it therefore fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cloſe my Letter, to reſume ſome conſiderations, which I forbore to mention when they occurred, for fear of ſtraying from the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us, the Clergy and their Goods are Sacred things, and the pceuliar Lot of God. This, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is a great, and even to the Laity, beneficial Truth. Yet 'tis to be ſuſpected He did not penetrate it enough, becauſe he concludes wrong, that they are therefore both quite out of the reach of Secular power. One might take a fancy to argue them out of the reach of the Eccleſiaſtical too. For what has any man to do with what properly belongs to God? If you ſay the Eccleſiaſtical power is from God; ſo likewiſe is the Secular. And ſo people might with fruitleſs Conceits and Repartee's, go on in endleſs wrangling.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore reflect a little on what every body knows, that God neither ſtands in need of any created good, nor is capable of receiving either good or harm from Creatures. For that eſſential and overflowing fulneſs of his own perfection can neither get nor loſe. That overflow of goodneſs has created man for the good of man, not God, and all material nature beſides, not for its ſelf, or for God, but purely for the uſe of man. Likewiſe what he commands, or requires of man, is only for the benefit of man, who by obeying or diſobeying does himſelf good or harm, but none to God. Thoſe Phraſes therefore of ſerving God, being his, and the like, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions introduc'd by his mercy in condeſcendence to our weakneſs, to raiſe us up by the aw of his interpoſing, more ſteadily to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe actions, which in truth are profitable only to our ſelves. We have the whole benefit of the ſervice we are ſaid to do him; and in reality ſerve our ſelves, when we are ſaid to ſerve him. So likewiſe the things which are called his, are neither taken from us, nor ſpent in any uſe of his, to whom nothing can be uſeful, but ordered by him to be employed in a way moſt beneficial to us, in which they would either not at all,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106994:211"/> or not ſo well and readily be employ'd, if we were not aſſiſted by an apprehenſion of a particular concern, or propriety of his in them. Applying this to the Clergy, when They, or their Goods are called the Lot of God, given or conſecrated to him, peculiarly his, and what elſe is ſaid of this kind, 'tis not that He is ſubject to the <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> found in the World; nor can his property have the ſame Notion, which ours has in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Goods or Servants, who are wrong'd when they are taken away, or diſpoſed of, without our conſent. But the meaning is, that They are eſtabliſht in a way of life in which by actions proper to it, they are to employ Themſelves and their Goods, to the greateſt advantage of themſelves and their Neighbour. From which that they be not diverted by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or intereſt, or violence, to ends leſs beneficial to mankind, He is intitled to them, that who neither cares nor fears to wrong another man, may be checkt by the fear of wronging God, againſt whoſe Anger there is no Shelter.</p>
                     <p>And very requiſite it is, it ſhould be ſo. A Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth can no more be without Clergy, than Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Becauſe they are men, They cannot be without ſuch things as the nature of men requires, Meat to feed, and Cloaths to cover them; and this not only what is barely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve them from Hunger and Cold; but, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the World is, where Poverty is alwaies accompanied with abjection and ſcorn, in a proportion which may keep them in reputation with thoſe among whom They live, and with whom in a condition of Contempt They would want credit to do them the good they ought. Beſides, there muſt be Churches for people to Aſſemble in; The ſervice there, muſt not be ſlovenly, and ſordid, and apt to tempt thoſe who come, to irreverence, or abſtain from coming again for ſcorn. You I know blame our Church for exceſſive Pomp in the Sacred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I for my part, think no Pomp can be too much. Had you reflected as much as I have done on the nature of man, and how ſtrong the Animal part is yet in the beſt of us, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you would be of my mind. But letting that paſs, there goes expence to all this, and who will be moſt thrifty in the Service of God, will find it cannot be performed in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way for a little.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:106994:211"/>
                     <p>Chriſtianity would quickly be in a lamentable caſe, if the Clergy had not wherewith to maintain themſelves, as 'tis fit They ſhould be maintained; or their maintenance depended on the Capricio's of often froward, and ſometimes malicious men. They muſt of neceſſity either diminiſh into a number too ſmall, or languiſh in a contempt unable to benefit the World. If there were no money to build Churches, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to keep them in repair, no allotments for the expences of the Service in them; within a while there would be either no Churches, or no Service in them. If They were debar'd the exerciſe of their Functions, or tranſplanted into other Callings, or ſo taken up with other employments, that they could not attend their own, whether by the humorous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of other men, or their own irregular paſſions, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt needs loſe the benefit it receives by them, and that is no leſs than the hopes, becauſe the means, of a happy Eternity.</p>
                     <p>That both the men therefore, and the Goods appropriated to theſe ends, be look'd upon as Sacred, and appropriated in a peculiar manner to God, and wicked or inconſiderate men be aw'd by the fear of Sacriledge, from prejudicing Chriſtianity, by medling with either, is a great mercy of God, and great benefit to Man. But it follows not therefore, They may on no occaſion be touch'd. A Clergy-man may become wicked, and hardned, and obſtinate in wickedneſs. The good of the Common-wealth may require, that the incorrigible offender be cut off, whether for Example, or to avoid perpetual Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and diſturbances to particulars, or ſometimes hazard to the whole. Can any man think, if this be a requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary good, that God would hinder it, and that He who neither has, nor can have other end in all he commands, then good to man, ſhould command what is harmful to man? The injury to him, if any could be done him, would be to harbour ſo prepoſterous a conceit of him, and his commands, as if he would be diſpleaſed when we did our ſelves good. But if the Temporal Sword muſt be uſed, 'tis evident it muſt be uſed by the Temporal Power, for the Spiritual has it not to uſe. And becauſe it muſt not ſtrike blindly, the Temporal Power muſt alſo take cognizance of the matter, and ſee why, and when, and how far it is fit to ſtrike.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106994:212"/>
                     <p>For the reſt, here is great reaſon They ſhould be exempted from Magiſtracy, and Souldiery, from Trades, Offices, and whatever Services of the Common-wealth. For their own Function plainly requires a whole man, whether you look upon the qualities neceſſary for it, neither to be gained, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without long and conſtant pains; or the perpetual, and thoſe neceſſary occaſions of exerciſing, it. Between both, They have employment for every minute of time they have, and for more if they had it, and muſt of neceſſity neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their own duty, if any conſiderable part of their time be taken with any other. Again, as a man of no eſteem ſhall be but ill heard of, whatſoever he ſpeaks, there will be ſmall efficacy in their Exhortations to vertue and good life, if They be not in good reputation. Wherefore, if at any time They yield to the temptations of human frailty, it is but fit their faults be kept as much as may be from the eyes of the Vulgar, and rectified among themſelves. And if they have Judges of their own quality, to end their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and correct their miſdemeanours, and preſerve their reputation unſoyl'd with the Laity, the benefit is not leſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more to the Laity than to Them. In fine, 'tis for the advantage of the Common-wealth, that They have whatever is uſeful to perform in the beſt manner a Function, which is more advantagious to the Common-wealth, than any other is or can be. And if the Common-wealth grant Them not all ſuch Exemptions or Priviledges, or however you will call them, it plainly wrongs it ſelf. But yet it is the Common-wealth which grants them. For as for Judges, unleſs they Act in the nature of Arbitrators, by voluntary conſent and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the partys, They cannot proceed to force, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Temporal Sword; and however Eccleſiaſtical the Perſons be, the Judges are pure Secular Judges, when they proceed in that manner. Again, ſince no perſon nor his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice can be taken from the Common-wealth without its good will, and conſent, the other Exemptions are alſo from the Common-wealth; though peradventure in things apparently inconſiſtent with the Function, to allow the Function may be to grant the Exemption without more ado. That of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judges is more ſubject to the circumſtances of Time and Place, and therefore more depends on the pleaſure of Common-wealths,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106994:212"/> which alſo proceed differently, as every one finds moſt convenient for itſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for their Goods, to note this briefly by the way, The Clergy were at firſt rather Truſtees, or Stewards than Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Being look'd upon as men free from affections to the things of this World, the piety of rich men gave largely to them, to maintain Themſelves, and the Poor, whence their Revenues got the name of the Patrimony of the Poor, beſides to keep the Churches in repair, and furniſh the expences of the Service in it. The money thus given was put into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hands, and by his appointment diſtributed to the ſeveral uſes by the Deacons, who gave account of their diſtribution to the Biſhop. Afterwards the paſſions of men giving occaſion to complain of inequality in the diſtributions, this Arbitrary management was altered by Canons, and the Whole divided into four parts. One for the Poor; another for the Clergy; a third, for Repairs; the fourth for the Biſhop and his Family, to exerciſe Hoſpitality. In proceſs of time this too was changed. What became of the ſhare of the Poor, and Churches I cannot tell; but the Biſhop, and inferiour Clergy diſpoſed abſolutely, and independently, without any account, of their own. An opinion being ſet on foot, which does not reliſh with every body, even at this day, that they are true Proprietors of their Goods.</p>
                     <p>However it be, had They no more than is requiſite to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in the way in which 'tis fit they ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; or the over-plus were ſpent in the uſes before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and for which at firſt 'twas given; there is great reaſon to look upon their Goods, as the Lot of God, and upon taking them away as Sacriledge. Neither could the Common-wealth require any thing of them, without employing it in uſes leſs beneficial to It, than thoſe in which it is employ'd already; neither could there be any pretence to do it. For a Common-wealth in her greateſt exigencys, never takes from any ſo much as not to leave them wherewith to ſubſiſt. And 'twould be contrary to the end of Taxes if they ſhould. For Taxes are to preſerve what people have from Enemys. And no Enemy could take away more than All. So that the Common-wealth by ſo unjuſt a Tax would become the Enemy. But it never does Tax thoſe who have nothing to ſpare, and had the Clergy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106994:213"/> no over-plus, They would be in the condition of poor men, untaxable.</p>
                     <p>But when They have not only ſufficient, but abundance, and exceſs, it is extravagant to fancy the Common-wealth cannot take what is not needed, to employ it where it is. We ſee their exceſs, inſtead of preſerving, ſometimes diminiſhes their reputation, and expoſes them to the envy, and murmurs of people, who grumble to ſee the liberality, perhaps of their own Anceſtors, abuſed it may be to vanity. To intitle God to goods ſo employ'd, is to intitle him to the abuſe of things, and to Vanity. Nor can any thing be more ridiculous, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is neceſſary for his Service, ought be eſteemed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and his, to think that muſt be ſo too which is employ'd not in his Service, ſometimes againſt it, and his Laws too. In ſhort, if the Common-wealth need it, and They can ſpare it, It is injurious to God to fancy he would have any thing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd leſs uſefully for man than it might be.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, I conceive They have from God the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Keys: They have Commiſſion to go and teach, and Baptize all Nations: They have aſſurance of his perpetual aſſiſtance in the execution of their Commiſſion, and of a Wo if they execute it not, and whatever elſe appears in the Sacred Books or Tradition. The Piety of Men ſuperadded the reſt, ſome more neceſſary, all convenient, and which, as many as they are, I wiſh were more. And ſo I take my leave both of Them and You, remaining</p>

                  <p>YOUR Poſtſcript makes me a very ſtrange Complement. For why ſhould you think me the only honeſt man? Had you addreſt your ſelf to others, as you might to divers, who would have told you the ſame tale, They, it ſeems, would have been the honeſt men, and I for want of luck, in your black Roll. And yet I think it more poſſible for thouſands of my Religion to get through the grace of God, an intire Maſtery over the corruption of Nature in all particulars, than that any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Laws ſhould make all the Subjects of a Nation honeſt men. In ſhort, we inherit the Doctrines, and we inherit the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of our Anceſtors the Primitive Chriſtians, and while you will have it fo, muſt inherit their hard fate too, and bear the burthen of other Folks folly.
